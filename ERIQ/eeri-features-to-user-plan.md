# EERI Features According to User Plan

## PART 1 — Evaluation of Current EERI Pro Dashboard

### Strengths

**1. Clear Hierarchical Risk Presentation**

The dashboard correctly starts with:
- Real-time index card
- Component breakdown
- Asset stress panel

This matches how institutional desks think.

**2. Excellent Explainability Layer**

- Top Drivers module
- Component transparency
- Historical intelligence
- Regime statistics

These are premium-grade features. Very rare.

**3. Proper Multi-Scale Risk View**

Coverage includes:
- Instant risk state
- Structural history
- Driver analysis
- Market exposure

This is exactly how professional risk intelligence tools operate.

### Missing Piece (Strategically Important)

Currently lacking a **mid-timeframe interpretive layer**.

Available:
- Daily interpretation
- Historical analytics

Not available:
- **Weekly intelligence summary**

That gap is what the Weekly Snapshot fills.

---

## PART 2 — Where Weekly Snapshot Should Live (By Plan)

### PUBLIC EERI PAGE

*(Already implemented)*

**Placement:**
- After Risk Bands
- Before Daily Narrative

### USER DASHBOARD (All Paid Plans)

**Placement:**

```
Top Risk Drivers
      ↓
⭐ INSERT WEEKLY SNAPSHOT HERE
      ↓
Historical Intelligence
```

**Why This Placement Is Perfect:**

- Weekly Snapshot answers: *"How does this week fit into the trend?"*
- Historical Intelligence answers: *"How does the long history behave?"*

This is a natural cognitive bridge.

## PART 14 — Probability Calculation Schema (Backend)

Probabilities are designed to be:
- **Defensible** — "historical conditional tendencies"
- **Stable** — not jittery week-to-week
- **Auditable** — why the number exists
- **Tier-aware** — Free sees none, Personal sees light ranges, Pro sees confidence + persistence

### 1) Core Concept

Compute "next-week probabilities" conditioned on a **Weekly State**:

```
Weekly State =
  EERI band (based on weekly average)
  + EERI trend (rising/stable/falling vs prior week)
  + Divergence regime (confirming/mixed/diverging) [optional but powerful]
  + Optional: "shock week" flag (weekly high – low exceeds threshold)
```

Then ask historically:

> "For past weeks with the same state, what happened to each asset in the following week?"

### 2) Database Tables (Conceptual Schema)

```

### 4) Confidence Labeling (Marketable + Honest)

Confidence shown as a simple label tied to:
- Sample size bucket
- Dispersion (how inconsistent outcomes were)

**User-facing labels:**

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **High** | Stable tendency with enough history |
| **Medium** | Decent tendency, some variance |
| **Low** | Mixed outcomes or limited history |

This keeps it credible and avoids "fake precision".

### 5) How to Present Probabilities Safely

Public language should always be:
- "Historically, in similar EERI weeks..."
- "Tendency" not "forecast"
- Ranges not exact points (especially for smaller samples)

**Example line:**

> "TTF Gas: 60–70% tendency for elevated volatility next week (Confidence: Medium)."
