# GERI Sources Documentation

## Overview

GERI is the **Global Energy Risk Index**. Expanding regional news sources will increase accuracy, credibility, and predictive power. However, adding sources blindly can introduce noise and dilute signal quality, which is extremely dangerous for an index product.

Sources should be expanded using a **Risk Relevance Framework**, not a geographic checklist.

---

## Strategic Principle

Add sources from **high energy-leverage regions**, not simply "more regions".

GERI should focus on regions that can realistically:

- Move global oil / gas / LNG markets
- Affect transit chokepoints
- Influence supply chains
- Trigger geopolitical escalation

---

## Regional Tiers (By Energy Influence)

### Tier 1 — MUST ADD (High Impact Regions)

These are globally systemic.

#### Russia / Black Sea / Caspian

(Already partially captured via Europe, but should be treated as its own signal cluster.)

**Why Critical:**
- Major gas supply flows
- Ukraine transit risk
- Caspian pipeline system
- Black Sea shipping risk

**Recommended Sources:**
- Russian energy sanctions coverage
- Ukraine energy infrastructure updates
- Black Sea maritime risk

#### China

(EXTREMELY IMPORTANT — most indexes miss this)

**Why Critical:**

China drives:
- LNG demand shocks
- Coal vs gas substitution
- Industrial energy demand
- Supply chain stress
- Rare earth / renewables dependencies

China is often the hidden driver of global energy pricing.

#### United States

(Not just production — policy & exports)

**Why Critical:**
- Largest oil & LNG swing producer
- Strategic reserve releases
- Export regulation
- Sanctions policy driver

#### India

Underrated but rising.

**Why Important:**
- Rapid LNG demand growth
- Russian crude redirection
- Price-sensitive energy consumption

---

### Tier 2 — LNG / Transit Leverage Regions

#### Qatar
Global LNG backbone.

#### Australia
Major LNG exporter.

#### Norway
Europe gas backbone.
(Extremely important for EERI + GERI crossover.)

---

### Tier 3 — Chokepoint Regions (Massive Risk Multipliers)

These regions may produce little energy but control global flows.

#### Egypt / Suez Canal
Transit + LNG

#### Turkey
Pipeline hub between:
- Russia
- Caspian
- Middle East
- Europe

#### Indonesia / Malaysia
Strategic LNG + maritime corridors.

---

### Tier 4 — Emerging Supply Risk Regions

Add later.

#### Venezuela
Sanctions volatility

#### Nigeria
LNG disruptions

#### Algeria
Europe gas backup

---

## Recommended Regional Expansion Priority (Best ROI)

### Phase 1 — Immediate

Add:
- China
- United States
- Russia / Black Sea cluster
- Qatar
- Norway

### Phase 2 — Next 6 Months

Add:
- India
- Australia
- Turkey
- Egypt / Suez

### Phase 3 — Later

Add:
- Africa LNG exporters
- Latin America exporters

---

## Why Expansion Is Critical

### Current Coverage
Supply + geopolitical escalation focus

### What's Needed
Demand-driven shocks (China / India / US policy)

Lag / divergence models become statistically stronger when risk ingestion covers:
- Demand shocks
- Supply shocks
- Transit shocks
- Policy shocks

---

## How Expansion Improves GERI Scientifically

Better region coverage improves:

**Early Signal Detection**
China energy demand shifts often lead LNG price volatility.

**Reduced False Positives**
More regions = better confirmation scoring.

**Better Asset Prediction**
TTF and Brent respond differently depending on regional trigger origin.

---

## Suggested GERI Regional Weighting Model

(Conceptual — strong differentiator)

Instead of equal regional news weighting:

| Region Cluster | Suggested Influence Weight |
|---|---|
| Middle East | 25% |
| Russia / Black Sea | 20% |
| China | 15% |
| United States | 15% |
| Europe Internal | 10% |
| LNG Exporters (Qatar, Australia, Norway) | 10% |
| Emerging Supply Regions | 5% |

---

## Important Warnings

Do NOT expand without:

**Source Quality Filtering**
Not all news = market-relevant.

**Signal Deduplication**
Many sources report the same event.

**Severity Scoring Calibration**
Different regions generate different volatility impact.

---

## Smart Expansion Strategy

(What elite intelligence platforms do)

Add regions only when they:
- Move asset volatility
- Improve predictive correlation
- Improve confirmation score stability

---

## Strategic Recommendation for EnergyRiskIQ

Yes — expand beyond Europe & Middle East.

BUT focus on:
1. **China**
2. **United States**
3. **Russia / Black Sea**
4. **Qatar / Norway LNG clusters**

These four expansions alone would significantly increase GERI credibility and predictive power.

---

## Bonus Insight

Adding China alone often improves:
- LNG volatility detection
- Oil demand cycle detection
- Industrial macro energy demand signals

Most retail intelligence platforms miss this completely.

---

## PART 1 — GERI Global Risk Source Map

This defines:
- Which regions must be monitored
- Which countries inside each region matter
- What type of risk signals originate there
- Which assets each region historically impacts

### Region Cluster Model

GERI should NOT treat regions equally. It should treat them as **risk generators** and **risk transmitters**.

---

---

### Visual Mental Model

GERI should monitor the world like:

**Supply Core → Transit Routes → Demand Centers → Financial Spillover**

---

## PART 2 — Source Weighting Algorithm

This determines how each news event affects the GERI score.

### Step 1 — Event Base Severity Score

Each event gets:

```
Severity = EventMagnitude * EventCredibility * EventPersistence
```

**EventMagnitude** — Measures direct energy impact.

| Event Type | Magnitude |
|---|---|
| Pipeline explosion | 0.9 |
| Major sanctions | 0.8 |
| Military escalation | 0.7 |
| Production cut | 0.6 |
| Policy statement | 0.3 |

**EventCredibility** — Source reliability. Range: 0.5 – 1.0

**EventPersistence** — How long impact is expected to last.

| Duration | Value |
|---|---|
| Short shock | 0.5 |
| Structural change | 1.0 |

---

### Step 2 — Regional Influence Multiplier

```
RegionalScore = Severity * RegionWeight
```

**Suggested Region Weights:**

| Region | Weight |
|---|---|
| Middle East | 0.25 |
| Russia / Black Sea | 0.20 |
| China | 0.15 |
| USA | 0.15 |
| LNG Backbone | 0.15 |
| Transit Chokepoints | 0.10 |

---

### Step 3 — Asset Sensitivity Weight

Each region affects assets differently.

```
AssetImpact = RegionalScore * AssetSensitivity(region, asset)
```

Example:
- Russia → TTF = 1.0
- Russia → Brent = 0.7

---

### Step 4 — Contagion Multiplier

When multiple regions escalate simultaneously:

```
ContagionFactor = 1 + (NumberOfHighSeverityRegions * 0.08)
```

---

### Final GERI Event Impact

```
GERI_Event_Impact =
    Severity
    * RegionWeight
    * AssetTransmissionWeight
    * ContagionFactor
```

---

## PART 3 — Risk Transmission Model

This models HOW risk travels through the system. This is a huge differentiator.

### 3-Layer Transmission Flow

**Layer 1 — Event Shock Layer**
Where the event originates.
Example: Iran shipping disruption.

**Layer 2 — Energy Market Transmission**
How the event changes:
- Supply flows
- Demand expectations
- Transport costs

**Layer 3 — Financial Transmission**
How markets react:
- Oil pricing
- Gas pricing
- Currency shifts
- Volatility spikes

---

### Transmission Speed Model

Different assets react at different speeds.

| Asset | Typical Reaction Lag |
|---|---|
| Freight | 0–2 days |
| TTF Gas | 1–5 days |
| Brent Oil | 2–7 days |
| EUR/USD | 3–10 days |
| VIX | 1–4 days |

---

### Transmission Strength Function

```
AssetResponse =
    EventImpact
    * TransmissionElasticity
    * LiquidityModifier
```

---

### Transmission Feedback Loop

Important advanced feature. Markets can amplify risk.

```
If VIX spike > threshold:
    Increase GERI by feedback multiplier
```

---

## PART 4 — News Ingestion Expansion Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Strengthen Core Global Coverage

**Timeline:** Immediate (1–2 months)

**Add:**
- China energy policy + LNG demand
- US LNG + shale + SPR
- Russia / Black Sea security
- Qatar + Norway LNG

**Goal:** Improve GERI predictive correlation with TTF & Brent.

---

### Phase 2 — Add Transit & Logistics Intelligence

**Timeline:** 3–6 months

**Add:**
- Suez / Red Sea shipping security
- Panama Canal drought effects
- Turkish pipeline hub developments

**Goal:** Improve freight and shipping risk modeling.

---

### Phase 3 — Demand & Macro Integration

**Timeline:** 6–12 months

**Add:**
- India demand trends
- Asia LNG spot market signals
- Global industrial energy consumption

**Goal:** Improve medium-term energy demand forecasting.

---

### Phase 4 — Structural Energy Transition Risk

**Timeline:** 12+ months

**Add:**
- Renewables intermittency risk
- Grid stability issues
- Critical minerals supply chain

**Goal:** Future-proof GERI.

---

### Source Selection Criteria

Every new source must pass:
1. Market Impact Probability
2. Signal Originality
3. Historical Correlation
4. Source Credibility

---

## Scientific Advantage

By implementing this architecture, GERI becomes:

- Not a news aggregator
- Not a sentiment index

But: **A multi-layer energy risk transmission model**

Very few commercial platforms have this.

---

## Strategic Reality Check

If you implement:
- Regional clustering
- Weighted event scoring
- Transmission modeling
- Multi-phase ingestion

**GERI becomes extremely difficult to replicate.**

---

## PART 5 — GERI Event Taxonomy System

Classifies ALL energy risk events. This is the foundation layer — everything else depends on it.

### Purpose

Event taxonomy allows GERI to:
- Score risk consistently
- Train AI classification
- Measure transmission patterns
- Enable explainability

---

### Level 1 — Primary Event Domains

Every event MUST belong to one of these.

#### Supply Disruption Events

Physical energy availability threats.

**Subcategories:**
- Pipeline disruption
- Production outage
- Sanctions on producers
- Export restrictions
- Infrastructure sabotage
- Weather-related production loss
- Labor strikes

#### Transit & Logistics Events

Energy transportation risks.

**Subcategories:**
- Chokepoint security threat
- Shipping attack
- Canal blockage
- Port congestion
- Maritime insurance shock
- Freight surge

#### Demand Shock Events

Consumption or industrial energy demand changes.

**Subcategories:**
- Industrial slowdown
- Economic stimulus
- Fuel substitution policy
- Strategic reserve usage
- Seasonal demand anomaly

#### Policy & Regulatory Events

Government interventions affecting energy markets.

**Subcategories:**
- OPEC production decision
- Energy export restrictions
- Sanctions policy expansion
- Environmental regulation
- Tax / subsidy changes
- Strategic alliances

#### Geopolitical / Military Escalation

Conflict-driven risk.

**Subcategories:**
- Military strike
- War escalation
- Regional armed conflict
- Terror attack
- Diplomatic breakdown

#### Structural Energy Transition Events

Long-term systemic risk.

**Subcategories:**
- Grid instability
- Renewables intermittency
- Critical minerals shortage
- Infrastructure modernization failure

---

### Level 2 — Event Attributes

Each event must carry:
- EventDomain
- RegionCluster
- SeverityLevel
- PersistenceType
- DirectEnergyImpact
- TransmissionType

---

### Level 3 — Severity Scoring Template

```
EventSeverity =
    PhysicalImpactScore
    + MarketPsychologyScore
    + DurationExpectationScore
```

Each scored 0–1 and weighted.

---

## PART 6 — Risk Regime Classification Engine

Defines macro energy market states.

### Regime Types

#### Normal Regime
- GERI < 35
- Low volatility
- Stable supply/demand balance

#### Tension Regime
- GERI 35–55
- Localized disruptions
- Market sensitive but stable

#### Crisis Regime
- GERI 55–75
- Multiple risk drivers
- Supply uncertainty
- Freight & gas react strongly

#### War Shock Regime
- GERI > 75
- Active military or systemic conflict
- Cross-asset volatility
- Severe supply uncertainty

#### Stabilization Regime
- GERI declining after crisis
- Markets remain volatile but normalizing

---

### Regime Detection Formula

```
RegimeScore =
    GERI_Level
    + MomentumFactor
    + RegionalConcentrationFactor
    + ContagionScore
```

**MomentumFactor** — Measures acceleration of risk.

**RegionalConcentrationFactor** — Measures if risk originates from one or multiple clusters.

**ContagionScore** — Measures cross-asset confirmation.

---

### Regime Transition Logic

```
If GERI increases AND momentum rising → Escalation regime
If GERI decreases BUT volatility remains → Stabilization regime
```

---

## PART 7 — Cross-Asset Predictive Probability Model

Predicts how markets respond to events.

### Model Goal

Estimate probability:

```
P(Asset Move | Event Type + Regime + Region)
```

### Model Structure

**Step 1 — Event Feature Vector**

```
EventVector = {
    EventDomain,
    RegionCluster,
    Severity,
    Persistence,
    RegimeState
}
```

**Step 2 — Asset Sensitivity Matrix**

Predefined sensitivity scores:

| Asset | Supply Events | Transit | Demand | Policy | War |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Brent | 0.9 | 0.7 | 0.6 | 0.8 | 0.9 |
| TTF | 0.8 | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.7 | 0.7 |
| VIX | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.4 | 0.7 | 0.9 |

**Step 3 — Probability Function**

```
ProbabilityMove =
    Sigmoid(
        EventSeverity
        * AssetSensitivity
        * RegimeAmplifier
        * HistoricalResponseFactor
    )
```

---

### Output Types

- ProbabilityLargeMove
- ProbabilityVolatilitySpike
- ProbabilityLaggedResponse

---

### Historical Response Factor

Uses rolling historical reaction:

```
ResponseFactor = ObservedAssetMoveAfterSimilarEvents
```

---

## PART 8 — News Deduplication & Signal Scoring AI Design

Critical once sources expand.

### Problem

Multiple sources often report:
- Same event
- Slightly different wording
- At different times

If untreated → artificial risk inflation.

---

### Solution Architecture

**Step 1 — Semantic Event Clustering**

Use NLP embeddings to group articles.
Cluster if similarity > threshold.

**Step 2 — Source Credibility Weighting**

Each source gets:

```
CredibilityScore =
    HistoricalAccuracy
    + SourceAuthority
    + ReportingSpeed
```

**Step 3 — Event Confidence Score**

```
Confidence =
    NumberOfIndependentSources
    * AverageCredibility
    * ContentConsistency
```

**Step 4 — Temporal Deduplication**

If multiple articles occur within time window:
Merge into single EventObject.

**Step 5 — Signal Amplification Guard**

Prevent overcounting:

```
If EventClusterDetected:
    Apply diminishing returns function
```

---

### Event Clustering Output Object

```
EventCluster {
    PrimaryEventSummary,
    Region,
    Domain,
    SeverityScore,
    ConfidenceScore,
    SourceList,
    Timestamp
}
```

---

### Advanced Feature — AI Event Summarization

Each cluster generates:
- AI Risk Summary
- Impact Expectation
- Affected Assets
- Confidence Level

---

### Signal Quality Index

New internal metric. Measures:

```
SignalQuality =
    ConfidenceScore
    * SourceDiversity
    * HistoricalAccuracyAlignment
```

---

## System Integration Flow

```
News → Deduplication → Taxonomy → Severity Scoring → Regime Detection → Asset Prediction → GERI Calculation
```

---

## Strategic Power of This Architecture

You are building:
- A global energy risk ontology
- A dynamic market regime detector
- A predictive asset behavior engine
- A self-cleaning news intelligence system

That combination is extremely rare.

---

## Final Reality Check

If you implement this stack, GERI becomes closer to institutional geopolitical risk models than typical SaaS dashboards.
