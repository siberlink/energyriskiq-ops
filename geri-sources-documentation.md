# GERI Sources Documentation

## Overview

GERI is the **Global Energy Risk Index**. Expanding regional news sources will increase accuracy, credibility, and predictive power. However, adding sources blindly can introduce noise and dilute signal quality, which is extremely dangerous for an index product.

Sources should be expanded using a **Risk Relevance Framework**, not a geographic checklist.

---

## Strategic Principle

Add sources from **high energy-leverage regions**, not simply "more regions".

GERI should focus on regions that can realistically:

- Move global oil / gas / LNG markets
- Affect transit chokepoints
- Influence supply chains
- Trigger geopolitical escalation

---

## Regional Tiers (By Energy Influence)

### Tier 1 — MUST ADD (High Impact Regions)

These are globally systemic.

#### Russia / Black Sea / Caspian

(Already partially captured via Europe, but should be treated as its own signal cluster.)

**Why Critical:**
- Major gas supply flows
- Ukraine transit risk
- Caspian pipeline system
- Black Sea shipping risk

**Recommended Sources:**
- Russian energy sanctions coverage
- Ukraine energy infrastructure updates
- Black Sea maritime risk

#### China

(EXTREMELY IMPORTANT — most indexes miss this)

**Why Critical:**

China drives:
- LNG demand shocks
- Coal vs gas substitution
- Industrial energy demand
- Supply chain stress
- Rare earth / renewables dependencies

China is often the hidden driver of global energy pricing.

#### United States

(Not just production — policy & exports)

**Why Critical:**
- Largest oil & LNG swing producer
- Strategic reserve releases
- Export regulation
- Sanctions policy driver

#### India

Underrated but rising.

**Why Important:**
- Rapid LNG demand growth
- Russian crude redirection
- Price-sensitive energy consumption

---

### Tier 2 — LNG / Transit Leverage Regions

#### Qatar
Global LNG backbone.

#### Australia
Major LNG exporter.

#### Norway
Europe gas backbone.
(Extremely important for EERI + GERI crossover.)

---

### Tier 3 — Chokepoint Regions (Massive Risk Multipliers)

These regions may produce little energy but control global flows.

#### Egypt / Suez Canal
Transit + LNG

#### Turkey
Pipeline hub between:
- Russia
- Caspian
- Middle East
- Europe

#### Indonesia / Malaysia
Strategic LNG + maritime corridors.

---

### Tier 4 — Emerging Supply Risk Regions

Add later.

#### Venezuela
Sanctions volatility

#### Nigeria
LNG disruptions

#### Algeria
Europe gas backup

---

## Recommended Regional Expansion Priority (Best ROI)

### Phase 1 — Immediate

Add:
- China
- United States
- Russia / Black Sea cluster
- Qatar
- Norway

### Phase 2 — Next 6 Months

Add:
- India
- Australia
- Turkey
- Egypt / Suez

### Phase 3 — Later

Add:
- Africa LNG exporters
- Latin America exporters

---

## Why Expansion Is Critical

### Current Coverage
Supply + geopolitical escalation focus

### What's Needed
Demand-driven shocks (China / India / US policy)

Lag / divergence models become statistically stronger when risk ingestion covers:
- Demand shocks
- Supply shocks
- Transit shocks
- Policy shocks

---

## How Expansion Improves GERI Scientifically

Better region coverage improves:

**Early Signal Detection**
China energy demand shifts often lead LNG price volatility.

**Reduced False Positives**
More regions = better confirmation scoring.

**Better Asset Prediction**
TTF and Brent respond differently depending on regional trigger origin.

## Suggested GERI Regional Weighting Model

(Conceptual — strong differentiator)

Instead of equal regional news weighting:

| Region Cluster | Suggested Influence Weight |
|---|---|
| Middle East | 25% |
| Russia / Black Sea | 20% |
| China | 15% |
| United States | 15% |
| Europe Internal | 10% |
| LNG Exporters (Qatar, Australia, Norway) | 10% |
| Emerging Supply Regions | 5% |

---

## Important Warnings

Do NOT expand without:

**Source Quality Filtering**
Not all news = market-relevant.

**Signal Deduplication**
Many sources report the same event.

**Severity Scoring Calibration**
Different regions generate different volatility impact.

---

## Smart Expansion Strategy

(What elite intelligence platforms do)

Add regions only when they:
- Move asset volatility
- Improve predictive correlation
- Improve confirmation score stability

---

## Strategic Recommendation for EnergyRiskIQ

Yes — expand beyond Europe & Middle East.

BUT focus on:
1. **China**
2. **United States**
3. **Russia / Black Sea**
4. **Qatar / Norway LNG clusters**

These four expansions alone would significantly increase GERI credibility and predictive power.

---

## Bonus Insight

Adding China alone often improves:
- LNG volatility detection
- Oil demand cycle detection
- Industrial macro energy demand signals

Most retail intelligence platforms miss this completely.
