🔥 Improvement #1 — Add context to the number (VERY important)

Right now:

35  
MODERATE


This is good, but you should add:

scale reference

interpretation hint

Suggested upgrade:

Example:

35  
MODERATE  
(0 = minimal risk · 100 = extreme systemic stress)


or smaller:

Risk Level: 35 / 100

Why this matters:

new users immediately understand the scale

journalists understand how to quote it

credibility increases

This is a big clarity upgrade.

🔥 Improvement #2 — Make the trend line more expressive

Right now:

0.0 vs 7-day average


This is technically correct, but:

too dry

not emotionally informative

not directional

Suggested format:

Instead of:

0.0 vs 7-day average

Use:

Option A (professional)

Trend: Stable vs 7-day average

Option B (better)

7-day Trend: Stable (0.0)

Option C (best)

Short-term Trend: Stable

Why:

users think in “rising / easing / stable”

not in decimals

You can still keep the number subtly.

This improves:

readability

decision usefulness

UX clarity

🔥 Improvement #3 — Label “Top Drivers” more institutionally

“Top Drivers” is good, but you can make it more authoritative.

Suggested title options:

🔹 Primary Risk Drivers (best, institutional tone)

🔹 Main Risk Contributors

🔹 Key Risk Drivers

I strongly recommend:

Primary Risk Drivers

This is exactly the language used in:

rating agencies

risk reports

institutional research

🔥 Improvement #4 — Add categories to drivers (very powerful)

Right now drivers are just headlines.

You can massively increase value by subtly adding:

region

category

Example:

Instead of:

Video shows severely damaged building in Ukraine from Russian attack

Use:

🇺🇦 Ukraine — Geopolitical
Video shows severely damaged building in Ukraine from Russian attack

or:

Europe · Geopolitical
Video shows severely damaged building in Ukraine from Russian attack

Why this is huge:

users immediately see pattern

regions emerge naturally

categories cluster

analysts love this

This also prepares:

charts

APIs

enterprise feeds

This is a high-impact professional feature.

🔥 Improvement #5 — Expand “Top Regions” slightly

Right now:

Top Regions  
Europe  
Middle East


This is good, but you can make it more informative with:

Option A — Add order + emphasis

Top Regions

Europe

Middle East

Option B — Add intensity hint (very strong)

Top Regions Under Pressure
• Europe (Primary)
• Middle East (Secondary)

Or:

Europe — Elevated
Middle East — Elevated

This starts building:

regional risk analytics

future heatmaps

institutional tone

🔥 Improvement #6 — Add one small “Interpretation line” (very powerful)

This is a BIG professional trick.

Under the main block, add one single sentence like:

Example:

Current risk conditions indicate moderate structural stress in global energy markets, driven primarily by geopolitical tensions in Europe and the Middle East.

Why this is incredible:

explains the index in human terms

helps journalists quote you

increases trust

differentiates you massively

This one sentence alone can turn this into a reference page.
