🔥 2. What Should the PUBLIC Output of RERI Be?

This is where strategy matters a lot.

RERI is too valuable to fully expose publicly.

If you publish it wrong:

you destroy enterprise value

you give away your moat

you reduce pricing power

So we design:

Public = signal teaser

Paid = intelligence

Enterprise = data

🟡 Public RERI Output (recommended strategy)
Principle

Public RERI should:

build SEO

build authority

build habit

NOT allow reconstruction

NOT give trading advantage

So:

Show only today’s value + band + trend, delayed, no history, no components.

🔓 Public RERI Format (Homepage / Region Pages)

Example:

Middle East Escalation Index

Value: 88 (CRITICAL)
Trend: +12 vs 7-day average
Status: Escalation risk elevated

Drivers:

Iran unrest intensifies

Gaza escalation expands

Red Sea shipping threats

⚠️ Informational only. Not financial advice.
🔒 Full history, charts, and signals available to subscribers.

What NOT to show publicly

Very important — do NOT show:

time series

7/30/90 day charts

component values (S, H, O, V)

exact formula

asset overlaps

intraday updates

confidence metrics

Because:

With history + daily points, someone can rebuild your index for free.

That kills your moat.

🔐 Paid RERI Output (Pro users)

This is where RERI becomes very powerful.

For logged-in Pro users:

Per Region Dashboard

Show:

current value

band

trend

90-day curve

band history

escalation warnings

Example widgets:

“Days in CRITICAL (last 30d): 7”

“Escalation velocity: FAST”

“Asset pressure: Gas + Freight”

Still do NOT show:

raw components

weights

internal caps

🟥 Enterprise RERI Output (licensable)

This is your real gold.

Enterprise clients get:

full historical daily series

raw component columns

asset overlaps

velocity

driver IDs

API

This is what sells for:

€10k–€50k / region / year

€50k–€120k full pack

🧭 3. Public Positioning (very important for your brand)

You should present the two indices differently:

GERI — Public flagship

On homepage:

🔥 Today’s Global Energy Risk Index (GERI): 71 — ELEVATED  
Trend: +9 vs 7-day average


This becomes:

your brand index

SEO anchor

citation object

RERI — Public regional radar

On region pages:

🌍 Middle East Escalation Index: 88 — CRITICAL  
Trend: +12  
Key escalation signals detected


This builds:

region SEO

institutional credibility

subscription funnel

🧠 4. Strategic Truth (this is very important)

In real markets:

global indices are branding tools

regional indices are revenue engines

Almost all big data providers make money from:

regional risk

country risk

sector risk

Not from global aggregates.

By building:

GERI (global)

RERI (regional)

You are positioning EnergyRiskIQ as:

“The reference geopolitical & energy risk layer”

Which is exactly where:

Verisk

Eurasia Group

Stratfor

Refinitiv

ICE Data

play.

🔥 5. Final Recommendation (very clear)

Here is the optimal strategy for you:

Public

Publish:

GERI daily (24h delayed)

RERI daily per region (24h delayed)

Show only:

value

band

trend

top 2–3 drivers

No charts. No history. No components.

Pro (€49–€149)

live GERI

live RERI

charts (90 days)

band history

escalation warnings

Enterprise

feeds

APIs

history

components

asset overlaps

🧭 Final perspective

GERI answers:

“Is the world dangerous today?”

RERI answers:

“Where will my money / cargo / gas / insurance break first?”

And in institutions:

GERI builds reputation

RERI builds revenue
