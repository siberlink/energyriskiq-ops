✅ B) Probability Calculation Schema (Backend, auditable, tier-gated)

You want probabilities that are:

Defensible (“historical conditional tendencies”)

Stable (not jittery week-to-week)

Auditable (why the number exists)

Tier-aware (Free sees none, Personal sees light ranges, Pro sees confidence + persistence)

1) Core Concept

Compute “next-week probabilities” conditioned on a Weekly State:

Weekly State =

EERI band (based on weekly average)

EERI trend (rising/stable/falling vs prior week)

Divergence regime (confirming/mixed/diverging) (optional but powerful)

Optional: “shock week” flag (weekly high – low exceeds threshold)

Then ask historically:

“For past weeks with the same state, what happened to each asset in the following week?”

2) Tables you need (conceptual schema)
A) eeri_weekly_summary

One row per week.

week_id (e.g., ISO week or YYYY-WW)

week_start_date (Mon)

week_end_date (Sat)

publish_date (Sun)

eeri_avg

eeri_high

eeri_low

eeri_band_avg (enum: normal/elevated/high/severe/critical)

eeri_trend_vs_prev (enum: rising/stable/falling)

eeri_delta_vs_prev (numeric)

days_in_band_json (counts)

divergence_state_week (enum: confirming/mixed/diverging) (overall cross-asset)

notes_public (optional cached string)

Purpose: the canonical weekly record.

B) asset_weekly_summary

One row per asset per week.

week_id (FK)

asset_code (BRENT, TTF, EU_STORAGE, VIX, EURUSD)

weekly_return_pct

weekly_direction (up/down/flat)

weekly_volatility_proxy (optional: realized range or stdev)

alignment_to_eeri (confirming/mixed/diverging)

reaction_speed_label (fast/medium/lagging) (Trader+ generation input)

percentile_in_similar_band (optional bucket: 0–25/25–50/50–75/75–100)

Purpose: compact facts used by the generator and probability engine.

C) weekly_state_definition

Defines the “conditioning buckets” (so you can version and tune it without rewriting history).

state_version (e.g., v1)

state_id (string, deterministic key like SEVERE_RISING_CONFIRMING)

eeri_band_avg

eeri_trend_vs_prev

divergence_state_week (optional)

shock_flag (optional)

description (human readable)

Purpose: stable mapping of a week into a state bucket.

D) asset_next_week_outcome_definition

Defines outcomes so probabilities are interpretable and consistent.

outcome_version (e.g., v1)

asset_code

outcome_type (direction or volatility)

outcome_key (UP / DOWN / FLAT / VOL_SPIKE / VOL_NORMAL)

thresholds_description (human readable; keep internal)

display_label (user-facing)

Purpose: consistent “what counts as UP/DOWN/FLAT” per asset.

E) weekly_asset_transition_stats

This is the computed probability table (the product).

state_version

outcome_version

state_id

asset_code

next_week_outcome_key

probability_point_estimate (0–1)

probability_low (0–1) (for ranges)

probability_high (0–1)

confidence_level (LOW/MED/HIGH)

sample_size_n (integer)

sample_bucket (e.g., N<20, 20–50, 50–100, 100+)

last_computed_at

notes_public (one sentence you can display)

Purpose: “Given this weekly state, what tends to happen next week?”

F) plan_visibility_rules (optional but clean)

If you want backend enforcement for what to show per plan:

plan_code (FREE, PERSONAL, TRADER, PRO, ENTERPRISE)

feature_key (WEEKLY_SNAPSHOT, PROB_RANGES, CONFIDENCE, SAMPLE_BUCKET, ANALOGS, SCENARIOS)

visibility (true/false)

Purpose: deterministic gating.

next_week_tendencies (RANGES ONLY): [{asset, tendency, prob_low, prob_high, confidence}]

Trader+

Add:

reaction_speed labels per asset

conditional_state_label (“Severe + Rising + Mixed”)

Pro+

Add:

regime_persistence: {prob_low, prob_high, confidence, sample_bucket}

scenario_outlook: [{name, triggers, what_to_watch}]

Enterprise+

Add:

sector notes, spillover summary, multi-week persistence bands (if available)

4) Confidence labeling (marketable + honest)

You should show confidence as a simple label tied to:

sample size bucket

dispersion (how inconsistent outcomes were)

User-facing:

High = stable tendency with enough history

Medium = decent tendency, some variance

Low = mixed outcomes or limited history

This keeps it credible and avoids “fake precision”.

5) How to present probabilities safely

Public language should always be:

“Historically, in similar EERI weeks…”

“Tendency” not “forecast”

Ranges not exact points (especially for smaller samples)

Example line:

“TTF Gas: 60–70% tendency for elevated volatility next week (Confidence: Medium).”
