🧠 EnergyRiskIQ — Daily Geo-Energy Intelligence Digest

(Concept Framework)

🎯 1. Core Purpose of the Daily Digest

The digest should answer ONE strategic question:

👉 “What changed in global energy risk in the last 24 hours — and why does it matter?”

Not:
❌ listing alerts
❌ repeating news

But:
✅ interpreting systemic risk
✅ connecting alerts together
✅ translating risk → asset impact
✅ highlighting trend direction

⏰ 2. Publishing Time Strategy

Ideal time:

👉 07:30 – 09:00 CET
(Market prep window for EU + overlap with Asia close & US overnight)

This fits extremely well with your institutional positioning.

🧩 3. AI-Powered Daily Digest Structure

This is the gold standard structure I recommend.

📰 Section 1 — Executive Risk Snapshot

(Short. High authority. Must feel professional.)

Format:
GLOBAL GEO-ENERGY RISK SNAPSHOT
Date: {Today}
Based on Alerts from: {Yesterday}

Global Risk Tone:
🟢 Stabilizing
🟡 Elevated
🔴 Escalating

Key Drivers:
• ...
• ...
• ...

Net Systemic Impact:
{2–3 sentence AI interpretation}

AI Role

AI should:

• cluster alerts into themes
• determine trend direction
• detect cross-region contagion
• summarize systemic meaning

Example Output

Global risk remained elevated but stabilized, with supply-side concerns in Europe partially offset by improved LNG flow expectations. Freight volatility continues to signal hidden stress in supply routing.

📊 Section 2 — Index Movement Summary

This makes your digest proprietary and extremely valuable.

Include:

• GERI movement
• EERI movement
• EGSI movement (when ready)
• RERI regional shifts

Format:
INDEX MOVEMENTS (24h)

GERI:
Current: 58 (+4)
Trend: Rising
Interpretation: Moderate systemic risk expansion

EERI:
Current: 63 (+7)
Driver: EU storage uncertainty

RERI – Middle East:
Current: 72 (+2)
Driver: geopolitical escalation signals

AI Task

AI must:

👉 connect index moves to alerts
👉 explain "WHY it moved"

Not just show numbers.

🌍 Section 3 — Top Risk Events of the Day

(From alerts database)

Limit to:

👉 Top 3–5 most systemic alerts

Format:
1️⃣ {Alert Title}

Region:
Category:
Risk Severity:
Confidence Level:

Why It Matters:
{AI interpretation}

Possible Spillover:
{Assets / Regions}

This is VERY powerful because:

You transform alerts into:
👉 analyst commentary

🔗 Section 4 — Cross-Market Impact Map

(This is where you become unique vs news outlets)

AI should connect alerts → asset classes:

LIKELY MARKET IMPACT

Oil:
↑ Short-term volatility expected

Natural Gas:
↑ EU pricing sensitivity rising

Freight:
→ rerouting signals emerging

FX:
USD safe-haven flows strengthening


You can eventually automate this via:

Alert → Asset sensitivity weights
You already design this in your architecture.

📈 Section 5 — Risk Trend Context

(This builds historical intelligence)

RISK TREND CONTEXT

Last 7 Days:
Risk trending upward due to multi-region escalation

Last 30 Days:
Supply-chain disruptions dominate risk environment


AI can compare:

• yesterday vs rolling baseline
• detect regime shifts

This is institutional gold.

🔮 Section 6 — Forward Risk Watchlist

(This is EXTREMELY engaging content)

AI predicts:

👉 what to watch next

WATCH LIST (Next 48-72h)

• European storage reports
• OPEC production signals
• LNG shipping congestion


This makes digest:
👉 forward-looking
👉 sticky
👉 trader-friendly

🧭 Section 7 — Strategic Interpretation

(This is your brand voice section)

This should be human-like AI commentary.

EnergyRiskIQ Analyst Note:

Current risk environment suggests localized escalation rather than global systemic shock. However, freight and gas indicators show early stress signals that historically precede oil market repricing.


This is HUGE for authority.

🤖 4. How AI Should Build the Digest (Architecture Concept)
Step 1 — Pull Data

From your alerts table:

alerts
WHERE date = yesterday


Include:
• severity
• confidence
• region
• category
• asset impact

Step 2 — Cluster Alerts

AI groups alerts into themes:

Example:
• EU supply stress
• Middle East geopolitical
• Logistics disruptions

Step 3 — Calculate Risk Signals

AI calculates:

• Alert density
• Weighted severity
• Regional concentration
• Asset exposure

Step 4 — Generate Narrative

Use structured prompt:

You are EnergyRiskIQ Intelligence Engine.
Interpret systemic geo-energy risk using provided alerts.
Avoid news repetition.
Focus on risk meaning and market impact.
