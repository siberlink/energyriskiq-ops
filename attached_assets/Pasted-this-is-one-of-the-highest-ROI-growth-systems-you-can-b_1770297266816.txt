this is one of the highest-ROI growth systems you can build for EnergyRiskIQ. Well-designed upgrade prompts typically drive 30–60% of SaaS conversions when done correctly.

Below is a complete Upgrade Prompt Strategy System designed specifically for your:

GERI chart intelligence positioning

Multi-plan ladder

Analyst-grade audience (traders, analysts, institutions)

Non-spam, credibility-first brand tone

This is production-ready UX + behavioral logic + copy templates.

⭐ Core Philosophy of Upgrade Prompts (VERY IMPORTANT)

Upgrade prompts must NEVER feel like:

❌ Paywall
❌ Sales interruption
❌ Feature blocking frustration

They must feel like:

✅ Analytical discovery
✅ Professional tool expansion
✅ Natural progression
✅ “You are ready for this insight”

🧠 The EnergyRiskIQ Upgrade Psychology Model

Users upgrade when they hit ONE of these moments:

1️⃣ Insight Curiosity Moment

"I see something… I want deeper explanation."

2️⃣ Analytical Limitation Moment

"I need this tool to finish my analysis."

3️⃣ Risk Urgency Moment

"I need alerts / divergence / confirmation RIGHT NOW."

4️⃣ Professional Identity Moment

"This platform matches how I work."

Your prompts must target these 4 moments.

🧩 PART 1 — Trigger Map (When Prompts Should Appear)
🎯 Trigger Type A — Feature Attempt Trigger

(Most powerful — conversion 25–45%)

Occurs when user tries locked functionality.

Example Triggers
User Action	Plan	Upgrade Target
Select second asset overlay	Personal	Trader
Click Divergence Mode	Personal	Trader
Select Z-Score	Trader	Pro
Click Compare Period	Trader	Pro
Try Annotations	Pro	Enterprise
Try Unlimited Overlay	Pro	Enterprise
🎯 Trigger Type B — Insight Exposure Trigger

(Subtle and extremely effective)

Occurs when user views data that implies deeper insight exists.

Examples:

Divergence detected but hidden

Strong confirmation score hidden

Lag intelligence hidden

🎯 Trigger Type C — Time-Based Engagement Trigger

Occurs when user shows commitment.

Example logic:

IF session_time > 4 minutes
AND user used chart controls
THEN show soft upgrade insight card

🎯 Trigger Type D — Risk Event Trigger (VERY HIGH CONVERSION)

When GERI spikes OR regime shifts occur.

This is extremely powerful.

Example:

"Energy risk just entered HIGH regime. Divergence analytics now available in Trader Plan."

🧩 PART 2 — Upgrade Prompt UI Types

You should implement FOUR prompt styles.

⭐ 1. Inline Locked Feature Tooltip (Most Natural)

Appears directly inside disabled control.

UX Example

User clicks Divergence Mode → Tooltip appears:

🔍 Divergence Analysis is available in Trader Plan

See when markets disconnect from risk signals.

Upgrade to unlock:
✔ Divergence zone detection
✔ Lead/Lag intelligence
✔ Market confirmation scoring

[View Trader Plan]

Rules

✔ Appears instantly
✔ Small footprint
✔ Educational tone
✔ No pricing push initially

⭐ 2. Context Insight Card (Best Conversion Tool)

Appears beside chart or below interpretation panel.

Example Trigger

Hidden divergence detected.

UX Example
⚠ Hidden Signal Detected

GERI suggests TTF Gas may be lagging risk conditions.

Trader Plan users can see:
• Historical lag timing
• Divergence detection zones
• Confirmation scoring

[Unlock Trader Intelligence]


This prompt converts extremely well because:

👉 It feels like discovery
👉 Not sales

⭐ 3. Risk Event Banner (High Urgency)

Appears when market environment changes.

Example
🔥 Risk Environment Escalating

GERI moved from Elevated → High.

Advanced users are monitoring:
• Divergence risk
• Cross-asset confirmation
• Response strength modeling

Upgrade to Trader or Pro to track this transition live.

⭐ 4. End-Session Analytical Summary Prompt

Appears after user leaves chart or logs out.

Example:

📊 Today You Explored Energy Risk Trends

Upgrade to unlock:

✔ Full lifecycle history
✔ Multi-asset overlays
✔ Predictive divergence signals

Continue building your risk intelligence workflow.

🧩 PART 4 — Smart Timing Rules (Critical)
Frequency Control

Unlimited inline tooltips allowed

Cooldown Logic
If user dismisses prompt:
→ Hide for 48 hours

Escalation Logic
If user hits same locked feature 3 times
→ Show enhanced prompt with example insights

🧩 PART 5 — Behavioral Personalization (Advanced SaaS Growth)
Trader-Behavior Detection

If user:

Uses overlays repeatedly

Switches assets frequently

Uses long time ranges

Then emphasize:

"Market reaction intelligence"

Macro-Behavior Detection

If user:

Uses storage + EUR/USD

Uses long historical windows

Then emphasize:

"Systemic risk modeling"

🧩 PART 6 — Micro UX Details That Increase Conversion
Always show:

✔ What they gain
✔ Why it matters
✔ How it improves decision-making

Never show:

❌ "Upgrade to unlock feature"
Instead say:

✔ "See how markets react to risk"

🧩 PART 7 — Backend Trigger Logic Example
if (!flags.chart.can_use_divergence_mode) {
   showUpgradePrompt("divergence_trader")
}

🧩 PART 8 — Upgrade Prompt Data Model
{
  "trigger_type": "feature_attempt",
  "feature": "divergence_mode",
  "recommended_plan": "trader",
  "cooldown_hours": 48,
  "max_session_display": 2
}

⭐ MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIC RULE

Your upgrade prompts must sell:

👉 Better understanding of risk
NOT
👉 Features

Prompt Type	Typical Conversion
Feature Attempt	25-45%
Insight Card	15-30%
Risk Event Banner	20-40%
