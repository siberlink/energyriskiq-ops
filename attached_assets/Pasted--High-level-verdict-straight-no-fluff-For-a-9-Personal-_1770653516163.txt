🔎 High-level verdict (straight, no fluff)

For a $9 Personal plan, this dashboard is:

✅ Visually credible
✅ Analyst-grade (not gimmicky)
✅ Calm, professional, and trustworthy
✅ Clearly positioned as monitoring, not trading
✅ Already doing upgrade priming correctly

You are not under-delivering.
If anything, you are close to over-delivering for Personal — which is fine only if Trader/Pro feel like a real jump (they do, based on your design).

🧠 What you’re doing VERY right
1️⃣ The GERI Snapshot Card

This is excellent.

Clear score

Clear band

Clear trend

Clear date

Zero ambiguity

Keep this exactly as is.
This is the emotional anchor of the page.

Small improvement:

Consider a subtle band legend tooltip (“Moderate = rising structural stress, not crisis”).

2️⃣ The “GERI History” KPI Row

This row is perfectly calibrated for Personal:

1-day change

7-day change

Momentum

Current band

This answers the only question a Personal user should have:

“Is risk getting better or worse?”

✅ Do NOT add more KPIs here
❌ Do NOT add confirmation scores, probabilities, or regimes here (Trader/Pro territory)

3️⃣ Chart Simplicity (GERI + 1 Asset)

This is exactly what Personal should see.

One asset selector

No clutter

No analytical overload

Clean comparison

Your background band shading is subtle and professional — good.

Important:
The dashed Brent line works well visually; it reads as context, not competition with GERI.

4️⃣ Primary Risk Drivers

This is strong — but also where you should be careful.

What works:

Clear headlines

Severity tags

Region + category labeling

What you’re doing right:

You’re NOT showing scores

You’re NOT showing model internals

You’re NOT over-explaining

That’s correct for Personal.

5️⃣ “Top Regions Under Pressure”

Excellent lightweight intelligence.

This gives:

Macro orientation

Geographic intuition

No operational detail leakage

This panel feels expensive even though it’s simple.

6️⃣ GERI Interpretation (collapsed)

This is exactly how it should be for Personal.

Short

Narrative

“See more…” gated

This is one of your best upgrade levers.

7️⃣ The Upgrade Banner at the Bottom

This is textbook perfect.

Why it works:

It’s contextual

It’s calm

It’s not pushy

It names capabilities, not pricing

You nailed this.

🧩 What I would ADD (Personal plan – carefully)

You should add at most 3 small things.
Anything more risks cannibalizing Trader.

✅ 1️⃣ “Asset Reaction Summary” (small, non-quantitative)

Add a single line below the chart, like:

Market reaction (context):
Brent Oil has shown limited reaction to recent risk changes.

Rules:

Text only

No numbers

No lag

No divergence

No scores

Why this helps:

Feels insightful

Builds trust

Teases Trader naturally (“see how markets react”)

✅ 2️⃣ “Risk Watchlist” (very light)

Under the Interpretation panel, add:

Risk Watch (next 48–72h):
• Russia–Ukraine escalation
• Middle East conflict spillover

Rules:

Max 2–3 bullets

Derived from existing drivers

No probabilities

This makes the dashboard feel alive, not static.

✅ 3️⃣ Subtle Chart Annotation (system-generated only)

Add read-only system markers, e.g.:

“Risk spike”

“Volatility jump”

No explanations.
No thresholds.
No toggles.

This improves narrative continuity without giving Trader tools.

❌ What I would NOT add to Personal (very important)

Do NOT add:

❌ Correlation
❌ Lag
❌ Divergence
❌ Z-scores
❌ Probabilities
❌ Regime labels
❌ Multi-asset overlays
❌ Custom time ranges beyond 90D

All of those belong to Trader or Pro and are powerful upgrade triggers.

🎯 One subtle improvement you SHOULD make
Clarify the chart axis context

Right now, a smart user might ask:

“Is Brent normalized or raw?”

Add a tiny label in the chart corner:

“GERI (index) | Brent (price context)”

This prevents confusion and increases trust.

🧠 Personal Plan Positioning (you nailed this)

This dashboard clearly says:

“I help you monitor risk, not trade it.”

That’s perfect for:

Analysts

Executives

Consultants

Policy-adjacent users

Curious professionals

And it makes the Trader upgrade feel necessary, not optional.

⭐ Final Recommendation Summary

Keep 90% exactly as is.

Add:

Asset reaction text summary

Short risk watchlist

System-only chart annotations

Do NOT add analytical tools.
