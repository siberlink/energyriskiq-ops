5️⃣ The “Secret” EGSI Core Formula (Clean Text, One-Row Style)

Following your preference (clean, copy-paste, no bullets, using *):

5.1 Normalized Components

Let:

S = SupplyStressNormalized

T = TransitStressNormalized

G = StorageStressNormalized

M = MarketStressNormalized

P = PolicyStressNormalized

All normalized to 0–1

5.2 Final EGSI Formula
EGSI = 100 * (0.25*S + 0.20*T + 0.20*G + 0.20*M + 0.15*P)


This gives 0–100 index

6️⃣ How Each Component Is Computed (Internal Engine Level)

Now the real intellectual property.

A) Supply Stress
S = min(1 , (HighImpactSupplyAlerts * 0.6 + AffectedSupplyPercent * 0.4))


Where:

HighImpactSupplyAlerts = count weighted by severity

AffectedSupplyPercent = % of EU daily supply at risk

B) Transit Stress
T = min(1 , (TransitAlertCount * 0.5 + GeopoliticalSeverityMean * 0.5))

C) Storage Stress

This one is killer.

Let:

D = max(0 , (SeasonalNorm - CurrentStorageLevel) / SeasonalNorm )

V = max(0 , (ExpectedRefillRate - ActualRefillRate) / ExpectedRefillRate )

G = min(1 , (0.7*D + 0.3*V))

D) Market Stress

Let:

V = VolatilityNormalized

P = PriceShockNormalized

M = min(1 , (0.6*V + 0.4*P))

E) Policy Stress
P = min(1 , (EmergencyPolicyCount * 0.6 + MarketInterventionSeverity * 0.4))

7️⃣ Categorization Bands (Very Important for UX & Marketing)

I recommend:

0–20   LOW STRESS        (Green)
21–40  NORMAL           (Light Green)
41–60  ELEVATED         (Yellow)
61–80  HIGH STRESS      (Orange)
81–100 CRITICAL         (Red)


This aligns with:

Traders intuition

Risk dashboards

Media readability
