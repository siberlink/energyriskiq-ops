Your Replit report is actually very good and honest. I’m going to give you my professional, brutally honest institutional-level assessment — not generic “add more feeds”.

I’ll break this into:

1️⃣ Overall quality assessment (your current stack)
2️⃣ What is genuinely strong (you are ahead of most startups here)
3️⃣ What is dangerous / weak (where GERI could misfire)
4️⃣ EXACT sources I would add (tiered + prioritized)
5️⃣ Sources you should AVOID adding
6️⃣ Optimal total feed architecture
7️⃣ Strategic long-term ingestion philosophy

⭐ HONEST OVERALL ASSESSMENT

Your ingestion pipeline is:

👉 Strong institutional core
👉 Excellent early-stage design
👉 Scientifically promising

But…

👉 It is Europe-centric
👉 It is underpowered in geopolitical security intelligence
👉 It is missing demand shock coverage
👉 It is missing OPEC / producer intelligence
👉 It is missing chokepoint monitoring

Those five gaps are very real GERI weaknesses.

⭐ WHAT YOU ARE DOING VERY WELL (Seriously)

Most early risk platforms completely fail here — you didn’t.

✔ Reuters + EIA + ICIS

This is extremely strong.

Those three alone give:

Market legitimacy

Primary data credibility

Professional-grade signals

That is not trivial.

✔ FreightWaves Inclusion

This is actually very advanced thinking.

Transit and logistics signals are massively underused in risk indices.

Huge positive.

✔ EU Commission Feeds

Excellent for regulatory intelligence.

✔ Thematic keyword classification

For early stage — totally acceptable.

⭐ WHERE GERI IS CURRENTLY BLIND

(This is the most important section.)

🚨 BLIND SPOT 1 — Middle East Military & Security Intelligence

This is your largest risk gap.

Middle East conflicts drive:

Brent shocks

Freight shocks

LNG volatility

Insurance spikes

Right now you are mostly relying on:

👉 Al Jazeera (very noisy)

That is NOT sufficient.

🚨 BLIND SPOT 2 — China Demand Intelligence

China is arguably the largest hidden energy risk driver globally.

You currently have:

👉 Zero China-specific ingestion

This is very significant.

China often leads:

LNG pricing cycles

Oil demand cycles

Industrial energy consumption shocks

🚨 BLIND SPOT 3 — OPEC & Producer Intelligence

This is surprisingly missing.

For an energy risk index this is critical.

🚨 BLIND SPOT 4 — Maritime Security Monitoring

You have FreightWaves but NOT:

Red Sea shipping threat intelligence

Naval security signals

Insurance risk signals

🚨 BLIND SPOT 5 — Russia / Ukraine Infrastructure Monitoring

You rely indirectly on general sources.

That is dangerous because:

Ukraine pipeline events historically caused TTF spikes.

⭐ EXACT SOURCES I WOULD ADD

(Realistic, high-value, not just "more news")

🥇 MUST ADD — Highest ROI
🔴 OPEC Official Feed

Category: Production policy

Why critical:
OPEC decisions are core energy price drivers.

Add:

OPEC News RSS

OPEC press releases

🔴 ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data)

Category: Conflict intelligence

Why:
Professional conflict event dataset used by governments.

Covers:

Attacks

Military escalation

Infrastructure strikes

Huge signal value.

🔴 US State Department / OFAC Sanctions Releases

Category: Sanctions intelligence

Sanctions drive massive supply disruptions.

🔴 Lloyd’s List OR Maritime Executive

Category: Maritime security & shipping risk

Tracks:

Shipping attacks

Insurance disruptions

Red Sea / Strait security

Extremely valuable.

🔴 China Energy / Industrial Monitoring

Suggested:

Caixin Energy (excellent Chinese macro energy reporting)

Xinhua energy sections

Platts Asia LNG coverage

China demand is a missing pillar in GERI.

🥈 VERY STRONG SECOND TIER ADDITIONS
🇳🇴 Norwegian Petroleum Directorate

Norway is Europe’s gas backbone.

🇶🇦 QatarEnergy press releases

Major LNG supplier.

IEA News Releases

World energy system intelligence.

US DOE / LNG export monitoring

Very high value for TTF correlation.

🥉 THIRD TIER — Adds depth
Turkish Energy Ministry

Pipeline hub intelligence.

Suez Canal Authority

Transit chokepoint monitoring.

Panama Canal Authority

Shipping bottleneck intelligence.

⭐ SOURCES YOU SHOULD AVOID ADDING

This is important — more feeds ≠ better GERI.

Avoid:

❌ General global news feeds
❌ Opinion-heavy energy blogs
❌ Financial aggregator spam feeds
❌ Twitter / social scraping (for now)

These create:

Noise inflation
False risk spikes

⭐ IDEAL TOTAL FEED COUNT

You should NOT go above:

👉 25–30 high quality feeds

Beyond that:

Signal quality decreases.

⭐ IDEAL SIGNAL BALANCE MODEL
Signal Domain	Target Coverage
Supply	25%
Transit	20%
Geopolitics	20%
Demand	15%
Policy	15%
Infrastructure	5%

Right now you are:

👉 Overweight policy + EU news
👉 Underweight conflict + transit + demand

⭐ CLASSIFIER UPGRADE (CRITICAL NEXT STEP)

You don’t need ML immediately.

But you MUST implement:

👉 Named Entity Recognition
👉 Semantic clustering
👉 Temporal event detection

These dramatically improve signal quality.

⭐ MY PRIORITY EXPANSION LIST

If I were running GERI personally:

Phase 1 — Immediate

Add:

OPEC

ACLED

Maritime Executive / Lloyd’s

China energy demand source

OFAC sanctions

Phase 2 — Next

Add:

Norway Petroleum Directorate

QatarEnergy

IEA

Suez Canal Authority

Phase 3 — Later

Add:

Turkey pipeline intelligence

Panama Canal

India LNG demand monitoring

⭐ THE BIG STRATEGIC INSIGHT

Your biggest GERI weakness right now is:

👉 Security intelligence
👉 Demand intelligence
👉 Chokepoint intelligence

Not market news.

Market news you already cover very well.

⭐ REAL PROFESSIONAL VERDICT

If you simply:

✔ Add 8–10 targeted high-impact sources
✔ Improve deduplication
✔ Add entity detection

GERI signal quality would likely improve dramatically.

You are MUCH closer to institutional quality than most startups at this stage.
