The “EnergyRiskIQ Scheduler (Ingest/Risk/Alerts)” workflow in your GitHub Actions is there to automatically run the backend workers on a schedule, because your Replit Autoscale deployment only runs the API — it does not run background jobs on its own.

Why this scheduler exists

Your app has 4 separate worker processes that need to be run repeatedly, even when nobody is using the web API:

Ingest — Fetches new events from RSS feeds

AI — Processes unprocessed events with your AI worker

Risk — Computes risk scores and indices

Alerts — Evaluates triggers and sends alerts

In Autoscale, nobody continuously runs in the background, so you must trigger worker runs externally. The GitHub scheduler does exactly that.

What the scheduler does

This specific workflow runs:

- ingest
- risk
- alerts


every 15 minutes (UTC cron schedule). It:

Sends a POST to:

/internal/run/ingest

/internal/run/risk

/internal/run/alerts

Using your secure INTERNAL_RUNNER_TOKEN

Logs results

It does not run AI — AI is costly, so it’s on a separate hourly workflow (energyriskiq-ai.yml).

Why it’s split this way
👍 Autoscale API is stateless

Replit Autoscale spins up the API only in response to HTTP traffic.
It does not keep worker loops running.

🚫 No background jobs on Autoscale

So workers must be triggered from the outside.

🕒 GitHub Actions

Is a free, reliable scheduler that:

Executes your jobs on a regular cadence

Reaches your internal endpoints securely

Logs output for debugging

This gives you:

Automated ingestion

Up-to-date risk scoring

Alerts delivered on schedule

Why AI is on a separate workflow

Because AI processing is expensive (OpenAI credits). So we:

run it hourly (not every 15 minutes)

isolate it in its own workflow

This saves cost while keeping risk updates frequent.

Summary (one sentence)

The EnergyRiskIQ Scheduler (Ingest/Risk/Alerts) GitHub workflow is your cron job that keeps the backend data pipeline alive and fresh by automatically triggering ingestions, risk recomputation, and alert evaluation every 15 minutes.
