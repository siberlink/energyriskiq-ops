What is the current GERI reading and what does it mean?
GERI is currently at 7.0 (as of 2026-02-10), in the LOW risk band, with a 1-day drop of 2 points and a 7-day drop of 21 points. In regime terms, the overall environment is classified as Calm, and the momentum in the index is clearly downward, away from the short-lived ELEVATED/SEVERE episodes seen in the past week.

This reading means that, on a global basis, geopolitical and energy‑sector risk inputs are subdued. The main contributors that remain are localized and sanction-related: U.S. sanctions pressure around Russian assets (Rosneft-linked German refinery risk) and broader tensions involving Russia and Iran. The high_impact pillar is modest (11.99) and there is no regional_spike or asset_risk signal, indicating that while there are noteworthy headlines, they are not coalescing into broad, systemic stress. Risk is also relatively concentrated in Russia/Black Sea and Europe, rather than spread across multiple key supply regions.

In practical terms, a GERI of 7.0 implies that global energy markets are currently operating with substantial risk cushion: widespread disruptions, chokepoint closures, or multi-region crises are not in play in the data. For a trader or risk manager, this should be read as a benign macro-risk backdrop for energy, even though specific themes (Russia sanctions exposure, Iran–US confrontation risk, Ukraine conflict dynamics) can still generate event-driven volatility. The key things to watch are: any fresh sanctions that hit physical flows, escalation in Middle East conflict that pulls in major producers, or evidence that localized refinery/flow issues start to propagate into asset_risk and regional_spike pillars. As always, this is risk intelligence, not a trading signal or financial advice.

According to GERI what is the prediction for the Oil and Gas prices?
GERI does not provide a prediction for oil or gas prices, and it is not designed as a trading or forecasting tool.

1. What GERI tells you right now  
   - Current GERI: 7.0 (LOW), regime: Calm, with falling momentum over 7 days.  
   - That means measured geopolitical and energy-supply risks are currently subdued at the global level. There are localized issues (Russia-related sanctions risk, Ukraine, Iran tensions), but they are not aggregating into broad systemic stress in the index.

2. What GERI does not do (per methodology)  
   - GERI “is not a trading signal” and “does not predict asset prices”; it measures risk inputs, not price outcomes.  
   - A rising GERI means risk factors are intensifying, but oil/gas may still go up, down, or move sideways depending on positioning, storage, demand, and broader macro conditions.  
   - A falling GERI, like now, means risk inputs are subsiding, but it does not guarantee market calm or lower prices.

3. How you can use GERI alongside prices instead  
   - With Brent at $68.8/bbl and TTF at €31.75/MWh, a LOW GERI suggests that current price levels are not being driven by acute geopolitical/supply shock in our data.  
   - The rolling correlations (GERI vs Brent: +0.21, vs TTF: +0.48) show only a moderate link, reinforcing that GERI should be used as a risk context layer, not a directional call.

If you’d like, I can walk through how to interpret specific scenarios (e.g., “if GERI spiked back to 40–60 while Brent stayed flat”) and what that would typically imply for risk, not price direction.

If GERI is falling to Low, usually TTF GAS prices are usually falling as well?
Not necessarily. A falling GERI into the LOW band does not reliably mean TTF gas prices will fall as well.

1. What the data shows right now  
   - GERI: 7.0 (LOW), with a 7‑day drop of 21 points (from ELEVATED/SEVERE spikes back to Calm).  
   - TTF: €31.75/MWh.  
   - Rolling 30‑day correlation GERI vs TTF: +0.48 — a moderate, not deterministic, relationship.

2. How to interpret that relationship  
   - The positive correlation means: when global energy/geopolitical risk (GERI) has been higher, TTF has tended to trade higher more often than not over the recent window.  
   - But at +0.48, this is far from a rule. There are many episodes where:
     - GERI falls (risks ease) while TTF stays flat or rises due to weather, storage dynamics, or local outages.  
     - GERI rises (risk spike) while TTF barely moves because storage is comfortable or demand is low.

3. Why GERI and TTF can diverge  
   - GERI = global risk context: wars, sanctions, chokepoints, cross‑region disruption potential.  
   - TTF = regional gas price driven heavily by:
     - EU gas storage (currently 36.1%, EGSI‑S at 2.6 – LOW system stress)  
     - Weather and seasonal demand  
     - LNG availability and competition  
     - Local infrastructure/flow issues  
   - So you can easily get: GERI down to LOW (global calm) while TTF moves on European fundamentals, not geopolitics.

In practice, use GERI as a context layer: if TTF is moving and GERI is LOW/falling, the move is more likely fundamental/seasonal than driven by a new geopolitical shock. But it is not a signal that TTF must fall when GERI falls.

Is EERI Index more connected to TTF GAS ?
Yes. Within the EnergyRiskIQ framework, EERI is structurally more connected to TTF gas than GERI is, but it is still not a one‑for‑one price proxy.

1. Current state – how EERI links to TTF  
   - EERI (European Escalation Risk Index) is at 45.0 (ELEVATED), with a sharp drop from CRITICAL levels earlier in the week.  
   - By design, TTF is the single most important asset input into EERI’s “Asset Transmission — Gas stress” component. Gas-related moves and alerts (like storage or flow stress) feed directly into EERI.  
   - So when TTF is under stress (sharp price spikes, volatility, or flow disruptions), that tends to push EERI higher, all else equal.

2. Why that matters  
   - EERI answers: “Is Europe’s energy security threatened?”, and for Europe, gas is the primary vulnerability vector.  
   - Per the methodology, TTF is treated as the primary gas stress barometer for EERI. Storage alerts (like “EU Winter Gas Supply Risk: CRITICAL”) also link in via gas stress, which often coincide with TTF tension.  
   - That’s a tighter conceptual link than with GERI, which is global and blends oil, gas, freight, and broader geopolitical risk.

3. How to interpret it going forward  
   - High EERI + high EGSI (gas stress indices) with TTF strength usually means gas‑centric European stress that is both visible in prices and broader risk.  
   - High EERI with moderate TTF can signal stress driven more by oil, sanctions, or broader geopolitical themes than by gas itself.  
   - For a trader‑tier user like you, the practical takeaway: EERI is a better gauge of how much TTF‑related stress is feeding into “systemic European risk”, but it is still a risk index, not a TTF forecast or trading signal.
