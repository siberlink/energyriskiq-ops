📅 Index Date vs. Computation Timestamp

GERI is published as a daily reference index representing systemic risk conditions for a specific calendar day.

For accuracy, completeness, and audit integrity, the index follows a two-step publication process:

Index Date (Publication Date)

The Index Date identifies the calendar day whose risk conditions are being measured.

For example:
GERI — January 21, 2026 represents systemic energy risk conditions observed throughout January 21, 2026.

This date is the official historical reference used in:

archive pages

charts

research

licensing and reporting

Computed Date (Computation Timestamp)

The Computed Date records the exact timestamp when the index was calculated and published.

Because GERI incorporates all alerts and signals generated during the full calendar day, the index is computed after the close of the observation period, typically in the early hours of the following day.

Example:

Index Date: January 21, 2026

Computed At: January 22, 2026, 06:10 UTC

This ensures that:

all relevant events for the day are included

late-day developments are captured

daily snapshots are complete and reproducible

Publication & Governance Principles

This methodology follows standard benchmark and index publication practices used by institutional data providers:

Each index value reflects a full-day observation window

Computation occurs after the day closes

Each daily snapshot is:

published once

immutable

auditable

permanently archived

Once published, a GERI value is not revised or backfilled and represents the official historical record for that date.

Why This Matters

Separating the Index Date from the Computation Timestamp ensures:

full coverage of daily events and alerts

methodological consistency

stable historical time series

transparency for professional and institutional users

This approach guarantees that every published GERI value reflects a complete, final, and reproducible measure of systemic energy risk for the stated date.
