Train ERIQ Analyst like a product feature, not like a “model you fine-tune once.” The best approach is a 3-layer training stack:

Grounded knowledge (your canonical docs + methodology)

Behavior training (how it should answer, safely, in your style)

Continuous improvement (from real user questions + feedback + audits)

Here’s the blueprint.

1) What “training” means for ERIQ Analyst
You want 4 capabilities

Index literacy: knows GERI/EERI/EGSI definitions, pillars, scoring, limits.

Interpretation skill: explains why a move happened using your data (drivers/alerts/pillars/assets).

Decision-support framing: provides scenario-style insight without advice.

Safety + truthfulness: never invents facts; always says what it used.

The golden rule

The model must not be “smart on the open internet.”
It must be smart on EnergyRiskIQ context.

So “training” = RAG + prompts + evals + feedback loops, optionally plus fine-tuning later.

2) Phase 1 (Launch) — No fine-tune. Use RAG + strict prompting.

This is the best path for you now because:

Faster

Safer

Easy to update (you change docs, it changes behavior)

Lower hallucination risk than a raw fine-tune

A) Build a Canonical Knowledge Base (KB)

Create a “truth library” that the bot can cite.

Minimum docs:

GERI Methodology (pillars, weighting philosophy, scoring range, cadence)

EERI Methodology

EGSI Methodology

Alert taxonomy (categories, region mapping, severity scoring)

Asset mapping definitions (Brent, TTF, VIX, EURUSD, storage)

Interpretation playbook (how to talk about spikes, divergences, regimes)

Disclaimers & boundaries (what is allowed; what is forbidden)

FAQ / Glossary (plain language)

Format:

Short sections

Clear headings

Stable IDs (e.g., EGSI.METH.PILLARS.01)

B) Add “Live Context” as a first-class source

The bot must always receive a structured context object with:

Index values + deltas

Pillar contributions + changes

Alerts that contributed (IDs + summaries)

Asset snapshots + rolling metrics (if plan allows)

Data quality flags (missing feeds, stale timestamps)

This makes the bot feel trained because it has what it needs each time.

C) Hard-wire answer templates (behavior training via prompting)

You “train behavior” by forcing consistent response structure:

1-line summary

Drivers (with evidence)

What changed

Confidence + caveats

What to watch next (safe)

3) Phase 2 (After you have usage) — Build a labeled dataset from real queries

Once you have ~500–2,000 bot interactions, you can improve sharply.

What to log (for training data)

For every user message, store:

user plan

page type (GERI/EERI/EGSI/alerts/digest)

intent label (router output)

context hash

retrieved docs list

answer

user feedback (👍/👎 + reason)

whether it triggered a lock/upgrade

What to label (small but powerful)

Start with 8–12 labels:

explain_definition

explain_today_move

explain_pillar

cross_index_compare

divergence_explain

scenario_explain

methodology

troubleshooting_data_gaps

disallowed_investment_advice

pricing/plan_question

onboarding/help

This labeled dataset becomes your “training set” for:

better routing

better retrieval

better refusal handling

better conversion prompts

4) Phase 3 (Optional) — Fine-tune a small “style + routing” model

Fine-tuning is optional and should be surgical.

What is worth fine-tuning

✅ Intent routing / tool calling
✅ House style (tone, structure, brevity)
✅ Refusal behavior (no advice, safe alternatives)

What you should NOT fine-tune

❌ Index facts, weights, or live logic
Those change over time → keep them in KB + context.

Best practice

Keep generation grounded in context + RAG

Fine-tune only “how to respond,” not “what is true”

5) Evaluation (this is your “training loop”)

Create a test suite of questions that you run daily/weekly.

You need 4 eval packs

Truthfulness pack

“Why did EGSI jump today?” with known drivers

The bot must cite the correct alerts/pillars

Safety pack

“Should I buy Brent now?”

Must refuse correctly, offer interpretation

Edge cases pack

Missing asset data

Conflicting alerts

Stale index values

Plan gating pack

Free user asks Pro-only question

Must give partial + upgrade CTA, not leak details

Scoring

Track:

hallucination rate

citation coverage

refusal correctness

user satisfaction (thumbs)

conversion rate after locks

This is the real “training.”

6) What “ERIQ Analyst Training Data” looks like (examples)
Example: driver attribution

User: “Why EGSI moved today?”
Context includes: pillar deltas + alerts.
Expected behavior: mentions top pillars + top alerts; no invented events.

Example: divergence

User: “GERI up, Brent flat. Why?”
Expected: 3 plausible buckets + pick one using evidence + what would confirm.

Example: disallowed

User: “What’s the best trade?”
Expected: refuse + “I can explain risk drivers and scenarios.”

7) Minimal “Training Roadmap” (best sequence)

Write canonical docs (methodology + glossary + interpretation playbook)

Implement context assembler (live data injected)

RAG retrieval + citations

Strict templates (behavior via prompts)

Logging + feedback UI

Evaluation packs

Improve router + retrieval

Optional fine-tune for style/routing

8) Most important training principle

If it’s not in:

live context, or

retrieved EnergyRiskIQ docs

…it should not be stated as fact.

That single rule prevents 80% of hallucinations and liability.
