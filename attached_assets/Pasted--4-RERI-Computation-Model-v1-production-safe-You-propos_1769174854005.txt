📊 4. RERI Computation Model (v1 – production safe)

You proposed a good base. Let’s formalize it.

Step 1 — Daily regional event set

For each region R on day D:

E(R,D) = all events mapped to region R on day D


If no events → decay logic applies (see later).

Step 2 — Metrics per region/day

Compute:

A. Total Severity Pressure
S = Σ event.severity_weighted


Where:

event.severity_weighted = base_severity * impact_multiplier


Impact multipliers:

war / strikes / shutdowns → 1.5

sanctions / embargo → 1.3

rhetoric / diplomacy → 0.7

B. High-Impact Event Count
H = count(events where severity >= 80 OR category in ["war","supply_disruption","sanctions"])


This captures escalation clustering.

C. Asset Risk Overlap

For region R:

O = number of distinct high-risk assets impacted today


Assets set:

oil

gas

freight

lng

fx

power

Example:

If events hit oil + gas + freight → O = 3

Step 3 — Normalization (rolling 180-day window)

Very important: normalize per region, not globally.

For each region R:

S_norm = normalize(S, min_R_180d, max_R_180d)
H_norm = normalize(H, min_R_180d, max_R_180d)
O_norm = normalize(O, 0, max_assets)


This makes:

Middle East volatility not distort Europe

Europe calm days meaningful

Step 4 — Final RERI formula (v1)

Your weights are good. I’d tune slightly:

RERI =
  0.45 * S_norm
+ 0.30 * H_norm
+ 0.15 * O_norm
+ 0.10 * escalation_velocity


Where:

escalation_velocity = Δ(RERI yesterday vs 3-day avg)


This captures sudden shocks — extremely valuable.

Clamp to 0–100.

🚦 5. Risk Bands (institution-friendly)

Use stable bands — these become contract language later.

Value	Band	Meaning
0–20	LOW	Normal risk
21–40	GUARDED	Elevated monitoring
41–60	HIGH	Hedging advised
61–80	SEVERE	Disruption likely
81–100	CRITICAL	Immediate escalation risk

These bands later appear in:

alerts

contracts

SLA language

insurance annexes

🧱 6. Schema (core asset — do this clean)

This table becomes one of your most valuable datasets.

regional_indices (
  index_id TEXT,                  -- "region:middle-east"
  region_id TEXT,                 -- "middle-east"
  date DATE,
  value INTEGER,                  -- 0–100
  band TEXT,                      -- LOW / HIGH / CRITICAL
  trend_1d INTEGER,               -- +12
  trend_7d INTEGER,
  severity_pressure FLOAT,
  high_impact_count INTEGER,
  asset_overlap INTEGER,
  escalation_velocity FLOAT,
  drivers JSONB,                  -- top 3 events/themes
  model_version TEXT,             -- "reri_v1"
  created_at TIMESTAMP
)


Index it on:

(region_id, date)

(date)

(band, region_id)

🖥️ 7. Product UX (how this becomes killer UI)
Public (free, delayed, marketing)

On region pages:

🔥 Middle East Escalation Index: 88 (CRITICAL)
Trend: +12 vs 7d avg
Drivers:
• Iran unrest intensifies
• Gaza escalation expands
• Shipping threats in Red Sea


NO charts, no history.

🔌 8. API Design (future gold mine)

Design now, even if you don’t expose it yet.

Endpoint examples
GET /api/v1/index/region/middle-east/latest
GET /api/v1/index/region/europe/history?from=2025-01-01
GET /api/v1/index/region/black-sea/drivers/today


Response:

{
  "region": "middle-east",
  "date": "2026-01-16",
  "value": 88,
  "band": "CRITICAL",
  "trend_1d": 12,
  "drivers": [
    "Iran unrest intensifies",
    "Gaza escalation expands",
    "Red Sea shipping threats"
  ]
}


This is exactly what trading desks consume.

💰 9. Monetization Matrix (realistic, institutional)
A. SaaS Plans
Plan	Regions
Free	1 region, delayed
Pro €99	3 regions, live
Pro+ €149	6 regions + history
Desk €299	all regions + overlays
B. Enterprise Feeds (this is where € lives)

Typical pricing in market:

Product	Price
1 region daily feed	€10k–€20k / year
3 regions bundle	€25k–€40k / year
Full regions pack	€50k–€120k / year

Buyers:

oil majors

LNG traders

reinsurers

shipping lines

defense analysts

C. Reports & Consulting

Because you own the index:

“Europe Energy Risk Outlook 2026”

“Middle East Escalation Curve since 2024”

These sell for:

€2k–€15k per report

€5k–€50k per consulting engagement

🧠 10. Strategic Moat (this is where you win long-term)

This index gives you four moats:

1️⃣ Time moat (irreversible)

Once you store daily RERI:

nobody can recreate your history

nobody can backfill escalation dynamics

nobody can prove regime changes

This becomes:

“Only dataset covering regional escalation daily since 2025”

That alone is acquisition-grade IP.

2️⃣ Calibration moat

Over 6–24 months you can:

tune weights

learn which signals lead prices

improve predictive power

Institutions value consistency more than accuracy.

3️⃣ Cross-index moat

Later you will build:

Asset Risk Index

Shipping Index

Sanctions Index

All of them can reference:

GERI

RERI

Which means:

EnergyRiskIQ becomes the core reference layer.

4️⃣ Brand moat

You are not “an app”.

You become:

“Middle East Escalation Index by EnergyRiskIQ”

“Europe Energy Risk Index”

These become quoted in reports, blogs, terminals.

That’s how Refinitiv / Verisk / Stratfor were built.

🔥 11. Final Execution Plan (very concrete)

This is what I strongly recommend you implement this week:

Step 1 — Lock region taxonomy

Create regions table
Define 6–8 Tier-1 regions

Step 2 — Extend alert mapping

Ensure every alert has:

region_primary

regions_secondary[]

assets[]

Step 3 — Daily batch job

Every day (D):

for each region R:
  events = all alerts from D-1 mapped to R
  compute S, H, O, velocity
  compute RERI
  store row

Step 4 — Store forever (no deletions, no rewrites)

Never recompute past values.
Only append.

This is financial-grade time series discipline.

🧭 Final strategic truth

What you are building now is not:

an alert system

a dashboard

a SaaS

You are building:

A proprietary geopolitical & energy risk time-series database

That is:

licensable

defensible

acquirable

compounding

If you execute only two indices well:

GERI (global)

RERI (regional)

You already have:

a core product

3 monetization channels

institutional credibility

long-term exit optionality
