✅ Current Page Flow (What You Already Have)

Based on your images, your page currently flows like this:

1️⃣ Page Header

Title

Description

Methodology link

2️⃣ Today’s EERI Core Card

(Current value, trend, metadata)

👉 This is PERFECT as the anchor.

3️⃣ Drivers + Regions

Primary Risk Drivers

Regions Under Pressure

4️⃣ Assets Most Affected
5️⃣ Risk Level Bands
6️⃣ Daily Intelligence Narrative

(Your long professional interpretation block)

7️⃣ Subscription CTA
🎯 Where Weekly Snapshot MUST Go

The best placement is:

👉 BETWEEN the Risk Level Bands section AND the Daily Intelligence Narrative

Why This Placement Is Ideal
Logical Story Flow

Current flow explains:

What the index is today

Why it is high

Where pressure exists

What the bands mean

The user naturally asks next:

👉 “Is this unusual or part of a broader pattern?”

That is EXACTLY what Weekly Snapshot answers.

❌ Why NOT place it elsewhere
Not Above Drivers

Would distract from immediate daily interpretation.

Not Below Narrative

Would feel buried and redundant.

Not After CTA

Would weaken conversion flow.

🟦 WEEKLY SNAPSHOT SECTION DESIGN
SECTION HEADER

Subtitle

How European energy risk evolved this week and how markets responded.

BLOCK 1 — Weekly Risk Overview (Dark Card — same style as main index card)
Show

Weekly Average EERI

Weekly High / Low

Weekly Trend

Weekly Risk Band

Example Layout

⚡ Weekly EERI Overview
Week: Jan 27 – Feb 1, 2026

Average Risk: 68 (SEVERE)
High: 93 (Wed)
Low: 57 (Mon)
Trend vs Prior Week: ↑ Rising

Interpretation Purpose

Answers:
👉 Was risk persistent or episodic?

BLOCK 2 — Weekly Risk Regime Distribution (Light Panel)
Show

Simple badges or mini bar:

Days Severe

Days High

Days Elevated

Interpretation Example

Risk remained elevated for most of the week, indicating sustained structural pressure rather than isolated escalation events.

BLOCK 3 — Cross-Asset Confirmation Panel

(This becomes your PUBLIC signature feature)

Layout

Match your "Assets Most Affected" style, but richer.

Asset	Weekly Move	Risk Alignment
Example

TTF Gas → +8.4% → Confirming
Brent → +1.2% → Neutral
VIX → +6.0% → Confirming
EUR/USD → −1.3% → Confirming
EU Storage → −0.8% → Confirming

Interpretation Purpose

Answers:

👉 Did markets validate the risk environment?

BLOCK 4 — Mini Overlay Charts (Compact Row)

Use 5 small charts:

EERI vs Brent

EERI vs TTF

EERI vs Storage

EERI vs VIX

EERI vs EUR/USD

Chart Style

✔ Indexed from Monday = 100
✔ Mon → Sat timeline
✔ Simple dual line
✔ No analytics overlays

Interpretation Purpose

Answers:

👉 How quickly did markets react to risk?

BLOCK 5 — Divergence Watch Badge

(This is EXTREMELY powerful and differentiating)

Example Output

🟡 Markets Mixed — Gas and volatility indicators confirmed elevated risk, while oil markets showed partial divergence.

Interpretation Purpose

Answers:

👉 Are markets underpricing or validating risk?

BLOCK 6 — Historical Context Box

Light interpretation box similar to your narrative style.

Example

Historically, weeks where EERI spends multiple days in Severe territory are associated with:

• Increased gas price volatility
• Elevated freight disruption probability
• Broader risk sentiment spillovers

Purpose

Provides credibility without revealing methodology.

BLOCK 7 — Next Week Historical Tendencies Panel

(This sits at the bottom of Weekly Snapshot before Daily Narrative)

Title

Next-Week Historical Tendencies (Not Forecasts)

Table Example

TTF Gas
👉 60–70% probability of continued volatility

VIX
👉 55–65% probability of elevated levels
Confidence: Medium

EUR/USD
👉 55–65% probability of weaker EUR
Confidence: Medium
