MISSING FEATURES FOR TRADER PLAN

These are not Pro-level, but they are essential for Trader tier.

1️⃣ Asset Overlay Panel (VERY IMPORTANT)

You have the data already:
TTF, Brent, VIX, EUR/USD, Storage.

Trader plan MUST show correlation visually.

Add:

EGSI vs Assets Chart
Selectable:

• TTF
• Brent
• VIX
• EUR/USD
• EU Storage

Why?

Because traders want to see:

👉 Is price lagging stress?
👉 Is volatility leading stress?
👉 Is storage already priced in?

This is the #1 missing feature.

2️⃣ Divergence Indicator (Simplified)

Not full Pro model.

Just show:

TTF vs EGSI Divergence:
UNDERPRICED (−1.6σ)


This creates enormous perceived value.

3️⃣ Regime History Panel

Traders think in regimes.

Add:

Last 12 months regimes:
Normal 120 days
Elevated 160 days
High 60 days
Crisis 25 days


Or timeline chart.

Helps strategy building.

4️⃣ Analog Event Finder

VERY sticky feature.

Example:

Similar Stress Patterns:
Feb 2022 — LNG shock
Oct 2021 — Storage crisis


Click → show what happened to TTF.

This makes your real historical data a monetization weapon.

5️⃣ Risk Radar Panel (Simple Version)

Not Pro probability engine yet.

Just:

Risk Bias (Next 30 Days):
↑ Price volatility risk
↑ Storage draw risk
→ Supply disruption risk neutral


This bridges analysis → action.

6️⃣ Alert Impact Panel

Right now alerts exist but not trader-oriented.

Add:

If Stress Continues:
TTF risk band: +5% to +18%
Volatility risk: HIGH


No prediction guarantees — just scenario ranges.

⭐ STORAGE PANEL IS VERY GOOD

But add:

Storage vs Seasonal Chart

This is crucial for traders.

Line chart:
• Current storage
• Seasonal average
• Crisis years overlay

This is huge for credibility.

⭐ HISTORICAL CHART — GOOD, BUT ADD ONE THING

Add background shading by regime.

This is extremely powerful visually.

Example:

Green normal

Yellow elevated

Red high

Dark red crisis

Traders instantly understand regime structure.

⭐ WHAT YOU DID PERFECTLY

Your “What Changed Today” is outstanding.

This alone creates daily habit.

Your narrative summary is excellent too.

Keep those.

⭐ MONETIZATION STRATEGY COMMENT

Trader plan should feel like:

👉 “Market intelligence edge”

Pro plan should feel like:

👉 “Predictive intelligence engine”

So don’t add probabilities yet here.

But add correlations + divergence.

⭐ FEATURES YOU SHOULD NOT ADD TO TRADER

To protect Pro tier:

❌ Scenario simulation
❌ Probability % outputs
❌ Custom alert builder
❌ Backtesting panel
❌ Portfolio stress modelling

Keep those Pro/Enterprise.

⭐ MOST IMPORTANT DAILY RETENTION FEATURES

To grow EnergyRiskIQ with no audience, you need habit-forming features.

Add these:

1️⃣ Daily Stress Story

1 paragraph auto-generated.

You already started — good.

2️⃣ “What Changed Since Yesterday”

Already done — excellent.

3️⃣ Biggest Risk Driver of the Week

Small panel.

4️⃣ Stress Momentum Gauge

Like RSI but for stress.

These keep traders coming back.

⭐ PRIORITY ROADMAP FOR TRADER DASHBOARD

Do these in order:

#1 Asset Overlay Chart

Massive perceived value.

#2 Divergence Indicator

Huge upgrade driver.

#3 Storage vs Seasonal Chart

Institutional credibility.

#4 Regime History Panel

Professional feel.

#5 Analog Event Finder

Your historical data becomes moat.

#6 Risk Radar Panel

Bridges analysis → trading thinking.

⭐ FINAL PRODUCT STRATEGY COMMENT

You are building something rare:

A quantitative geopolitical-energy intelligence system.

If you continue like this:

👉 Personal = awareness
👉 Trader = market edge
👉 Pro = predictive engine

You will absolutely get paying users.

Especially because you’re targeting LNG analysts and traders (as we discussed in your LinkedIn/X strategy).
