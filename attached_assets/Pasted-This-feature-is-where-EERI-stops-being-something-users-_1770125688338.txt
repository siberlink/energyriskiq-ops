This feature is where EERI stops being something users “check” and becomes something that watches the world for them.
Conceptually, Alerts & Thresholds transform your index from information into delegation.

I’ll explain it from a user’s mental model, not from system mechanics.

What Alerts & Thresholds really are

Most alerts systems notify users when prices move.

Your alerts notify users when risk changes state.

That’s a completely different (and far more valuable) proposition.

The core promise is:

“I don’t need to monitor risk constantly — EERI will tell me when it matters.”

Why thresholds matter psychologically

Humans are bad at monitoring continuous signals.

Thresholds turn a continuous index into discrete moments of attention.

Instead of asking:

“Is 58 high?”

“Is 63 worse?”

“Is 79 dangerous?”

Users think:

“We crossed into HIGH risk.”

“We entered CRITICAL.”

“Something just changed.”

This reduces ambiguity and decision fatigue.

The meaning of each threshold (conceptually)
🔔 EERI ≥ 60 — High Risk Regime

This answers:

“Should I start paying close attention?”

Risk is no longer background noise

Clustering is forming

Sensitivity to news increases

This is an early-warning alert.

🔔 EERI ≥ 70 — Severe Risk Regime

This answers:

“Should I review exposure and assumptions?”

Systemic stress is present

Multiple components are aligned

Secondary effects are likely

This is a prepare-to-act alert.

🔔 EERI ≥ 80 — Critical Risk Regime

This answers:

“Is the system under real strain right now?”

Crisis conditions

Market behavior may decouple from fundamentals

Non-linear moves become more likely

This is a pay-attention-now alert.

Why day-over-day change alerts are essential

Levels tell you where you are.
Changes tell you what’s happening.

Δ ≥ X alerts answer:

“Did risk accelerate suddenly?”

This catches:

Surprise escalations

Rapid clustering

Narrative shifts

Shock events

Even if the level stays below 60, a sharp jump matters.

Conceptually:

Velocity alerts detect surprises.

How users actually use these alerts

Professionals don’t act on alerts alone.

They use alerts to:

Interrupt their day

Reprioritize attention

Open the dashboard with purpose

An alert is not the decision —
it is the permission to stop ignoring risk.

Delivery channels — conceptually
📱 In-app

This is the context-rich channel.

Used when:

User is already thinking about risk

They want to explore deeper

They want explanations

In-app alerts feel:

Analytical

Calm

Professional

📧 Email

This is the reflective channel.

Used when:

Users review risk once or twice a day

They want summaries, not noise

They archive intelligence

Email alerts feel:

Authoritative

Non-urgent

Considered

💬 Telegram (later)

This is the interrupt channel.

Used when:

Risk shifts quickly

Users need instant awareness

Attention is scarce

Telegram alerts feel:

Immediate

High-signal

Minimal

Important:

The same alert should feel different depending on the channel — not louder, just more concise.

Why this feature alone justifies subscription

Because it replaces:

Manual monitoring

Constant checking

Fear of missing escalation

Cognitive load

With:

“I’ll know when it matters.”

That peace of mind is worth far more than $49/month.

How alerts connect to the rest of the system

Alerts are not standalone.

They should always connect to:

EERI value → “What changed?”

Top Drivers → “Why did it change?”

Asset Stress Panel → “Where does it matter?”

Historical context → “Is this unusual?”

Alerts are the entry point into intelligence.

The subtle but powerful design choice

You should never allow:

Too many thresholds

Over-customization

Constant noise

Why?

Because:

A quiet alert system is trusted.
A noisy one is ignored.

This restraint is a feature, not a limitation.

Final conceptual takeaway

Alerts & Thresholds turn EERI into:

A guardian

A sentry

A filter

A focus tool

They don’t tell users what to do.
They tell users when to care.

And that is one of the most valuable services you can provide.
