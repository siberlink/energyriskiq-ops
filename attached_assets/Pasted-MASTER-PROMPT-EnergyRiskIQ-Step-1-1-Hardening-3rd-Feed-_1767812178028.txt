MASTER PROMPT — EnergyRiskIQ Step 1.1 (Hardening + 3rd Feed)

You are Replit AI acting as my senior engineer. We already completed Step 1 (ingestion + classification + API). Now implement Step 1.1 improvements ONLY (no AI summaries yet, no dashboards, no auth, no Stripe).

GOALS (must-do)
1) Add a 3rd RSS feed dedicated to GEOPOLITICAL events.
   - Add it to src/config/feeds.json (do not hardcode in code).
   - Choose a reputable RSS feed that is stable and legal to consume via RSS.
   - The pipeline must ingest successfully from all 3 feeds.

2) Improve classification quality WITHOUT using AI:
   A) Support a per-feed "category_hint" field in feeds.json:
      - Example: {"source_name":"OilPrice","feed_url":"...","category_hint":"energy"}
      - Allowed: geopolitical|energy|supply_chain
   B) Classifier scoring:
      - Score keyword matches as before
      - If tie or no matches, use category_hint as tie-breaker
      - If still unresolved, default to geopolitical
   C) Add a new DB column: classification_reason TEXT
      - Store something like: "energy_keywords=3;geo_keywords=1;sc_keywords=0;hint=energy;chosen=energy"
      - This will help debugging and later model evaluation.

3) Improve ingestion run stats:
   - Add columns to ingestion_runs:
     * total_items INT DEFAULT 0
     * inserted_items INT DEFAULT 0
     * skipped_duplicates INT DEFAULT 0
     * failed_items INT DEFAULT 0
   - Update ingest runner to populate these stats per run and store a short notes summary.

4) Consistency & docs:
   - Ensure README.md clearly states:
     - how to run API
     - what port it runs on (choose one and standardize)
     - how to run ingestion once
     - where feeds.json lives and how to add feeds
   - Keep the project structure unchanged unless necessary.

DATABASE MIGRATION REQUIREMENT
- Add migrations safely (ALTER TABLE if columns don’t exist).
- Do not drop tables or wipe data.
- Keep backward compatibility.

API
- Keep existing endpoints working.
- If you have /ingestion-runs already, keep it.
- No new endpoints required for this step.

DELIVERABLES
- Updated feeds.json with 3 sources (geo + energy + supply_chain).
- Updated classifier with category_hint tie-breaker.
- DB migration adding classification_reason and ingestion_runs counters.
- Updated ingest runner filling counters.
- README updated and accurate.
- Run ingestion once and confirm it inserts new events; then confirm GET /events/latest returns results.

Implement now.
