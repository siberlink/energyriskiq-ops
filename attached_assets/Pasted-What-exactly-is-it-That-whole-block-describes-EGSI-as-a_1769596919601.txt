What exactly is it?

That whole block describes EGSI as a single, asset-specific system stress index:

Measures physical + structural gas system stress

Built on 5 pillars: Supply, Transit, Storage, Market, Policy

Answers:
“How close is Europe to a gas shock?”

Sits cleanly in your original stack:

GERI → Global macro risk
RERI → Regional regime risk
EGSI → Asset / system risk (gas)


That is EGSI-S (System) — even though at that time we didn’t yet name it “-S”.

So:

🔹 This is not obsolete
🔹 This is not contradicted
🔹 This is still your flagship institutional index

Why did EGSI-M appear later?

Because of implementation reality, not because the concept changed.

Later, when you asked:

“Which should I implement first?”

“How do I launch faster with what I already have?”

We introduced EGSI-M (Market / Transmission) as a derived, fast-launch variant:

Anchored to RERI_EU

Uses your existing alert engine

No dependency (initially) on structured storage/refill/weather data

Optimized for speed, daily cadence, and market sensitivity

👉 EGSI-M was added as a tactical layer, not a replacement.

The clean mental model (this is the key)

Think of it like this:

Index	What it is	Role
EGSI-S	The real Europe Gas Stress Index	Structural / institutional / licensing
EGSI-M	Gas market-stress transmission indicator	Fast, reactive, trader-oriented

Or in one sentence:

EGSI-S tells you how fragile the gas system is.
EGSI-M tells you how violently risk is transmitting today.

Why the original description still matters most

Everything you quoted is what:

Utilities

Policymakers

Procurement teams

Regulators

Serious institutional clients

will ultimately care about.

That original EGSI:

Is methodologically defensible

Is licensable

Can stand alone without GERI/RERI

Is what you put on a Methodology PDF and sell via API

EGSI-M cannot replace that — it complements it.

Final verdict (no ambiguity)

✅ The long description you pasted = EGSI-S (System)

✅ It is exactly what EGSI was meant to be

✅ It remains your flagship, long-term index

➕ EGSI-M is an additional, tactical index you introduced later for speed and leverage

If you want, next I can help you:

Rename things cleanly in the UI so users never get confused

Decide whether EGSI-M should be branded as:

“EGSI-Market”

“EGSI Signal”

“EGSI Transmission Index”

You’re not backtracking — you’re layering like an institutional platform would.
