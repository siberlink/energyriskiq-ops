🔟 Frequently Asked Questions
Is EnergyRiskIQ financial or investment advice?

No. EnergyRiskIQ provides informational risk intelligence only.
We do not provide investment advice, price targets, trade signals, or recommendations to buy or sell any asset.

Our alerts and risk scores are designed to help users understand changing geopolitical, energy, and supply-chain risk conditions, so they can make their own informed decisions in accordance with their own strategies, risk tolerance, and professional advice.

How is EnergyRiskIQ different from news websites or news aggregators?

Traditional news platforms show what happened.
EnergyRiskIQ focuses on how risk is evolving.

Key differences:

We quantify risk using rolling indices and severity weighting

We track trend direction (rising, falling, stable)

We filter noise and alert only when risk meaningfully changes

We connect events to energy, freight, and FX impact

You don’t need to read dozens of articles — we alert you when it matters.

How does EnergyRiskIQ decide when to send an alert?

Alerts are triggered only when predefined risk thresholds are crossed, such as:

Significant regional risk score increases

High-impact geopolitical or energy events

Rapid changes in asset-level risk (oil, gas, freight, FX)

Each alert includes:

The reason it was triggered

The drivers behind the risk change

The likely areas affected

No constant notifications.
No alert fatigue.

What sources does EnergyRiskIQ use?

EnergyRiskIQ continuously monitors:

Geopolitical developments (conflicts, sanctions, disruptions)

Energy markets (oil, gas, LNG, pipelines)

Supply-chain events (ports, shipping routes, strikes)

We combine multiple public and industry sources and process them through structured classification and AI analysis to produce consistent risk signals.

Which regions are covered?

Currently:

🇪🇺 Europe (primary focus)

Europe is prioritized because:

Energy security is tightly linked to geopolitics

LNG, pipelines, shipping lanes, and sanctions have immediate impact

Many global supply chains route through or into Europe

Additional regions will be added in the future.
