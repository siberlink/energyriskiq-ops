Below is a conceptual, behavioral interpretation of each band — what is happening in the world, how markets tend to behave, and how users should mentally respond.

🟩 0–20 — NORMAL

Background risk

What’s happening

Geopolitical and energy-related events are isolated

Supply chains function normally

Markets absorb news without stress

No clustering, no persistence

Risk exists — but it’s ambient, not directional.

How markets behave

Prices respond mostly to fundamentals

Volatility is low and mean-reverting

Headlines fade quickly

How to interpret this

“The system is stable. Risk is not the dominant variable.”

This is when:

Markets are efficient

Noise dominates signal

Overreacting is the biggest danger

🟨 21–40 — ELEVATED

Early tension / alert phase

What’s happening

Early signs of geopolitical or supply stress

Narratives begin to repeat

Markets are attentive but not alarmed

Stress is forming, not spreading

How markets behave

Selective sensitivity to news

Brief volatility spikes

Divergence between assets

How to interpret this

“Something is forming — pay attention.”

This is a watch phase:

Don’t act yet

Start monitoring drivers

Check which assets are reacting

This band is often underestimated.

🟧 41–60 — HIGH

Active stress regime

What’s happening

Multiple high-impact events

Clear thematic dominance (war, supply, logistics)

Early clustering

Risk becomes persistent

This is no longer background noise.

How markets behave

Volatility increases

Correlations begin to rise

Safe-haven behavior emerges

Assets start reacting together

How to interpret this

“Risk is now a key market driver.”

This is where:

Risk management matters

Narratives start driving price

False calm becomes dangerous

🟥 61–80 — SEVERE

System under strain

What’s happening

Escalation is sustained

Supply or logistics constraints are binding

Second-order effects appear

Market psychology shifts

The system is tense.

How markets behave

Non-linear moves

Correlations spike

Liquidity thins

Reactions become asymmetric

How to interpret this

“The system is fragile. Expect surprises.”

This is when:

Historical analogs matter

Timing becomes difficult

Overconfidence is punished

🟥 81–100 — CRITICAL

Crisis conditions

What’s happening

Systemic stress dominates

Multiple components fully aligned

Shock propagation is active

Control narratives break down

This is not about if something breaks — it’s about where.

How markets behave

Dislocations

Gap moves

Policy intervention risk

Decoupling from fundamentals

How to interpret this

“The environment itself is dangerous.”

In this regime:

Preservation > optimization

Liquidity > return

Awareness > precision

This is when EERI is most valuable.

One critical conceptual point (very important)

These bands are not linear.

The jump from:

20 → 30 is mild

50 → 60 is meaningful

75 → 85 is dramatic

Risk accelerates non-linearly as bands increase.

That’s why the bands exist.
