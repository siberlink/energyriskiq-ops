EGSI (Europe Gas Stress Index) fits perfectly inside EnergyRiskIQ’s positioning — and strategically it’s one of the highest-value indices you can own in Europe.

This is not a “nice to have” index.
This can become one of your flagship monetization assets.

Let me design it for you properly, in EnergyRiskIQ style.

1️⃣ What EGSI Should Represent (Concept)

Europe Gas Stress Index (EGSI) measures:

“How stressed, fragile, and risk-exposed the European natural gas system is right now — across supply, transit, storage, prices, and geopolitics.”

It answers one killer question:

“How close is Europe to a gas shock?”

This is extremely valuable for:

Gas traders

Utilities

Energy companies

Industrial buyers

Policymakers

Hedge funds

2️⃣ Positioning inside EnergyRiskIQ Architecture

In your ecosystem:

GERI → Global macro energy risk

RERI → Regional multi-asset energy + geopolitical risk

EGSI → Asset-specific system stress index

So:

EnergyRiskIQ
 ├── GERI (Global)
 ├── RERI (Regional)
 ├── EGSI (System / Asset level)


This gives you a multi-layer risk stack:
Macro → Regional → Asset System

This is exactly what institutional platforms do.

3️⃣ Core Dimensions of EGSI (What It Measures)

EGSI should be built from 5 stress pillars:

A) Supply Stress (Weight ~25%)

Measures how fragile supply is.

Inputs:

LNG terminal outages / maintenance

Pipeline disruptions (Norway, Algeria, Russia residual flows)

Force majeure events

Export restrictions

Signals:

Number of supply alerts

Severity of disruptions

% of EU supply affected

B) Transit & Geopolitical Stress (Weight ~20%)

Measures geopolitical and transit fragility.

Inputs:

Ukraine transit risk

Black Sea / Turkey corridor risk

Middle East LNG tensions

Sanctions, threats, conflicts

Signals:

High-impact geopolitical alerts

Transit-route mentions

Conflict proximity to infrastructure

C) Storage Stress (Weight ~20%)

This is very powerful and unique.

Inputs:

EU gas storage level vs seasonal norm

Refill speed

Winter deviation risk

Signals:

Storage below seasonal percentile

Refill velocity slowing

Policy interventions

You can later integrate public storage data (GIE AGSI).

D) Market Stress (Price & Volatility) (Weight ~20%)

Measures how stressed markets already are.

Inputs:

TTF volatility

Extreme daily moves

Backwardation / contango signals

Correlation with power prices

Signals:

Volatility spikes

Price shock events

Market dislocations

E) Policy & Regulation Stress (Weight ~15%)

Very underused — but extremely valuable in Europe.

Inputs:

Price caps

Emergency measures

Demand curtailments

Subsidies / rationing discussions

Signals:

Policy alerts

Emergency declarations

Market interventions

4️⃣ EGSI Output Format (Public-Facing)

I strongly recommend:

Europe Gas Stress Index (EGSI)

Current Level: 72 / 100  (HIGH STRESS)
Trend: +8 vs 7-day average

STRESS DRIVERS:
• Supply fragility elevated (LNG outages, Norway maintenance)
• Transit risk rising (Ukraine corridor uncertainty)
• Storage below seasonal norm (-6%)

SYSTEM STATUS:
Supply:        HIGH
Transit:       ELEVATED
Storage:       ELEVATED
Market:        HIGH
Policy:        NORMAL

INTERPRETATION:
European gas system is under increasing stress. 
High sensitivity to geopolitical or weather shocks.
