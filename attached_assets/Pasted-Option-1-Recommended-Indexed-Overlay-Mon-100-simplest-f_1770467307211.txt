Option 1 (Recommended): Indexed Overlay (Mon=100) — simplest, fastest, most robust

Use this when you want: movement comparison (risk → price), not “absolute level”.

Formula (for any series X)

Let 
𝑋
0
X
0
	​

 be the first value in the selected window (7D/30D/90D/All):

Indexed_X(t) = 100 * X(t) / X(0)

Do this for:

Brent price

TTF price

VIX close

EUR/USD rate

Gas storage (%)

And for EERI you have two choices:

Raw EERI on left axis (0–100), and assets indexed on right axis (clean semantics)

OR index EERI too if you want all lines to be relative (but label it clearly)

Best practice: keep EERI raw (0–100) and assets indexed (base=100) on a secondary axis.
It prevents confusion like “EERI > 100”.

Why this is “max efficiency”

O(1) per point (one divide + multiply)

Stable across units

Easy to cache per window

No heavy statistics required

Option 2 (Pro-grade): Z-score Standardization — best for “how abnormal is this?”

Use this when you want: stress intensity comparability (not just movement).

Formula (rolling window W)

For each asset X:

Z_X(t) = (X(t) − mean(X over W)) / std(X over W)

Then plot:

EERI raw (left axis)

Z-scores for assets (right axis, typically −3 to +3)

This makes “TTF is extremely high vs its own history” visually obvious.
But it is a heavier mental model for most users.

Efficiency note

Still efficient if you precompute rolling mean/std once per day (or cache per window), but more compute than indexing.

Gas Storage needs special handling (because it’s seasonal + bounded)

Storage is a % and seasonal. Two good representations:

A) Indexed (simple)

Storage_idx(t) = 100 * Storage(t) / Storage(0)
Good for weekly overlays.

B) “Seasonal deviation” (best, but more work)

Compare storage to typical seasonal level:

Storage_dev(t) = Storage(t) − median(Storage on same week-of-year, historical years)

This gives a real “storage tightness” signal (very valuable), but requires multi-year seasonal history.

My recommendation for your “EERI main graph/chart”

Your screenshot shows a Historical Intelligence chart for EERI with smoothing options. If you want to add assets onto that same graph:

Best “maximum efficiency + precision” design

Keep EERI raw on the left axis (0–100).

Add assets as Indexed to 100 at window start on the right axis.

Allow toggles for which asset lines are displayed (default OFF except one).

Label explicitly:

Left: EERI (0–100)

Right: Asset Indexed (start=100)

Subtitle: Assets rebased to 100 at start of range for comparability

This avoids the “EERI above 100” confusion entirely and is computationally trivial.

Smoothing (apply only to what makes sense)

EERI smoothing: OK (3D / 7D MA)

Assets smoothing: optional; if enabled, apply the same MA to the indexed series for fairness.

Moving average formula:

MA_k(t) = average of X(t−k+1 ... t)

Defaults:

7D view → Raw

30D view → 3D MA

90D / All → 7D MA

One more “precision” improvement (still simple)

For interpretation, show in tooltip both:

Raw asset value (e.g., Brent $/bbl)

Indexed value (e.g., 104.2)

% change vs start (e.g., +4.2%)

That keeps it honest and avoids “chart is abstract” complaints.

What I would NOT do on the main EERI historical chart

Don’t force everything onto one axis without indexing/standardizing (units clash)

Don’t convert EERI into an indexed series on the main historical chart unless clearly labeled (causes your exact confusion)

Don’t compute “correlation” on-chart for public; keep that Pro-only

Bottom line

For maximum efficiency and precision in a single UI:

EERI stays raw (0–100)

Assets are indexed: 100 * X(t)/X(0) on a secondary axis

Optional Pro mode: z-scores for “abnormality view”
