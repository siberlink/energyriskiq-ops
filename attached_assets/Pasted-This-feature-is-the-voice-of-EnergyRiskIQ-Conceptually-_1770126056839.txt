This feature is the voice of EnergyRiskIQ.
Conceptually, it turns EERI from a number into a daily narrative that professionals rely on.

I’ll explain what it really is, why it works, and how users experience it — not how it’s generated.

What the Daily EERI Intelligence Summary really is

It is not:

A news recap

A market commentary

An opinion piece

A forecast

It is:

A concise, authoritative risk briefing — written once per day, whether the world is calm or chaotic.

Think of it as:

A morning intelligence note

A daily situation report

A risk desk handover

The mental model for users

When a Pro user reads the summary, they should feel:

“I’m up to speed — I know the risk state today.”

They don’t need:

All the headlines

All the charts

All the data

They need orientation.

Why tying it to the index value is critical

The summary always starts with the index state:

“EERI closed at 83 (CRITICAL)…”

This anchors everything.

It immediately answers:

How bad is it?

Is this normal?

Should I care today?

Everything else is explanation.

The four conceptual pillars of the summary

Each summary should implicitly answer four questions — every day.

1️⃣ Where are we? (Level & Regime)

This is the opening sentence.

It tells the reader:

Risk level

Risk band

Whether this is unusual

Example concept:

“Risk remains in CRITICAL territory.”

This sets the frame.

2️⃣ Why are we here? (Drivers)

This explains:

What forces mattered most

What themes dominated

What kind of risk this is

Not a list of headlines — a distillation.

Conceptually:

“These are the few things that moved the needle.”

3️⃣ Where does it matter? (Assets)

This translates risk into exposure.

Users immediately learn:

Which markets are absorbing stress

Which are relatively insulated

This bridges:

Risk → Reality

4️⃣ How does this compare? (Context)

This is the stabilizer.

By comparing to:

7-day

30-day

Recent regimes

You prevent:

Overreaction

Alarm fatigue

You give perspective:

“This is elevated — but not unprecedented.”

Why this is so sticky

Professionals love routines.

This summary:

Arrives once per day

Is short

Is reliable

Is consistent in tone and structure

It becomes:

A daily check-in

A habit

A reference point

Over time, users feel uncomfortable not reading it.

That’s stickiness.

Why it is shareable (and why that matters)

The summary is:

Neutral

Non-promotional

Non-technical

Insightful

That makes it safe to:

Forward internally

Paste into Slack

Share with colleagues

Reference in meetings

This creates organic distribution without leaking IP.

Why perceived value is high

From the user’s perspective:

“Someone intelligent looked at a lot of complex data and told me what matters.”

That feels expensive.

Even though:

You already have the data

You already computed the index

You already know the drivers

You are monetizing interpretation, not computation.

Why it’s cheap (strategically)

Once the system exists:

No new data sources

No manual work

No editorial team

No human bottleneck

Yet users perceive:

Judgment

Insight

Curation

This is leverage.

How it fits into the broader product loop

The Daily Summary is the daily gateway:

Alert fires → user reads summary

Summary sparks interest → user opens dashboard

Dashboard confirms → user trusts the system

It closes the loop between:

Notification → Explanation → Exploration

Why this feature is Pro-only

Because it is:

Interpretive

Contextual

Synthesized

Public users should see:

Numbers

Headlines

Fragments

Pro users get:

The story those fragments tell.

That distinction is everything.

The emotional payoff

After reading the Daily EERI Intelligence Summary, users should feel:

“I’m not guessing today.”

That confidence is addictive — and extremely valuable.

Final strategic takeaway

This feature quietly does something huge:

It positions EnergyRiskIQ as:

A daily intelligence service

Not a dashboard

Not a feed

Not a tool

But a trusted daily briefing.

That’s how platforms become indispensable.
