🌍 PART 1 — GERI GLOBAL RISK SOURCE MAP

This defines:

• Which regions must be monitored
• Which countries inside each region matter
• What type of risk signals originate there
• Which assets each region historically impacts

⭐ REGION CLUSTER MODEL

GERI should NOT treat regions equally.
It should treat them as risk generators and risk transmitters.

Bab el-Mandeb
Turkish Straits

Asset Influence

Freight → EXTREME
Brent → HIGH
TTF → MEDIUM

⭐ Visual Mental Model

GERI should monitor the world like:

Supply Core → Transit Routes → Demand Centers → Financial Spillover

⚖️ PART 2 — SOURCE WEIGHTING ALGORITHM

This determines how each news event affects GERI score.

⭐ STEP 1 — Event Base Severity Score

Each event gets:

Severity = EventMagnitude * EventCredibility * EventPersistence

EventMagnitude

Measures direct energy impact.

Scale example:

Event Type	Magnitude
Pipeline explosion	0.9
Major sanctions	0.8
Military escalation	0.7
Production cut	0.6
Policy statement	0.3
EventCredibility

Source reliability.

Range: 0.5 – 1.0

EventPersistence

How long impact is expected to last.

Example:

Short shock = 0.5

Structural change = 1.0

⭐ STEP 2 — Regional Influence Multiplier
RegionalScore = Severity * RegionWeight


Suggested Region Weights:

Middle East = 0.25
Russia/Black Sea = 0.20
China = 0.15
USA = 0.15
LNG Backbone = 0.15
Transit Chokepoints = 0.10

⭐ STEP 3 — Asset Sensitivity Weight

Each region affects assets differently.

AssetImpact = RegionalScore * AssetSensitivity(region, asset)


Example:

Russia → TTF = 1.0
Russia → Brent = 0.7

⭐ STEP 4 — Contagion Multiplier

When multiple regions escalate simultaneously:

ContagionFactor = 1 + (NumberOfHighSeverityRegions * 0.08)

⭐ FINAL GERI EVENT IMPACT
GERI_Event_Impact =
Severity
* RegionWeight
* AssetTransmissionWeight
* ContagionFactor

🔄 PART 3 — RISK TRANSMISSION MODEL

This models HOW risk travels through the system.

This is a huge differentiator.

⭐ 3-LAYER TRANSMISSION FLOW
Layer 1 — Event Shock Layer

Where event originates.

Example:
Iran shipping disruption.

Layer 2 — Energy Market Transmission

How event changes:

• Supply flows
• Demand expectations
• Transport costs

Layer 3 — Financial Transmission

How markets react:

• Oil pricing
• Gas pricing
• Currency shifts
• Volatility spikes

⭐ Transmission Speed Model

Different assets react at different speeds.

Example:

Asset	Typical Reaction Lag
Freight	0-2 days
TTF Gas	1-5 days
Brent Oil	2-7 days
EUR/USD	3-10 days
VIX	1-4 days
⭐ Transmission Strength Function
AssetResponse =
EventImpact
* TransmissionElasticity
* LiquidityModifier

⭐ Transmission Feedback Loop

Important advanced feature.

Markets can amplify risk.

If VIX spike > threshold:
Increase GERI by feedback multiplier

🧭 PART 4 — NEWS INGESTION EXPANSION ROADMAP
⭐ Phase 1 — Strengthen Core Global Coverage

Timeline: Immediate (1–2 months)

Add:

China energy policy + LNG demand
US LNG + shale + SPR
Russia/Black Sea security
Qatar + Norway LNG

Goal:
Improve GERI predictive correlation with TTF & Brent.

⭐ Phase 2 — Add Transit & Logistics Intelligence

Timeline: 3–6 months

Add:

Suez / Red Sea shipping security
Panama Canal drought effects
Turkish pipeline hub developments

Goal:
Improve freight and shipping risk modeling.

⭐ Phase 3 — Demand & Macro Integration

Timeline: 6–12 months

Add:

India demand trends
Asia LNG spot market signals
Global industrial energy consumption

Goal:
Improve medium-term energy demand forecasting.

⭐ Phase 4 — Structural Energy Transition Risk

Timeline: 12+ months

Add:

Renewables intermittency risk
Grid stability issues
Critical minerals supply chain

Goal:
Future-proof GERI.

⭐ Source Selection Criteria

Every new source must pass:

Market Impact Probability
Signal Originality
Historical Correlation
Source Credibility

⭐ SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGE YOU ARE BUILDING

By implementing this architecture, GERI becomes:

Not a news aggregator
Not a sentiment index

But:

👉 A multi-layer energy risk transmission model

Very few commercial platforms have this.

⭐ Strategic Reality Check

If you implement:

• Regional clustering
• Weighted event scoring
• Transmission modeling
• Multi-phase ingestion

GERI becomes extremely difficult to replicate.
