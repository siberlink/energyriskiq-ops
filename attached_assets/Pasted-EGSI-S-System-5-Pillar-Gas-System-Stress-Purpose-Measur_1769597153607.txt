EGSI-S (System) — “5-Pillar Gas System Stress”

Purpose: Measure physical + policy + market fragility of Europe’s gas system.
Audience: utilities, risk teams, procurement, policymakers, serious traders.
Core output: “How close is Europe to a gas shock?”

A) Conceptual Model

EGSI-S is a weighted blend of 5 normalized pillars (0–1):

S Supply + T Transit/Geo + G Storage + M Market + P Policy

EGSI_S = 100 * clamp(0.25*S + 0.20*T + 0.20*G + 0.20*M + 0.15*P)

B) Data Inputs

EGSI-S mixes two data types:

1) Structured “state” data (recommended)

These feed Storage + Market, and improve Supply/Transit:

Storage level (EU % full, country % full)

Seasonal norm / percentile (e.g., 5y/10y average or percentile band)

Injection/withdrawal (refill speed)

Weather risk proxy (HDD forecast anomalies, or “winter deviation risk” proxy)

Market data (TTF spot/nearby, implied/realized vol, spreads if available)

2) Your existing unstructured alert stream (already in your engine)

These feed Supply/Transit/Policy and can also support Market:

LNG terminal outages, maintenance, force majeure

Pipeline disruptions, compressor outages

Sanctions, conflict escalation, threats to transit routes

Policy measures: caps, emergency declarations, rationing talk, subsidy shifts

Market shock events: “TTF jumps X%”, “extreme volatility”

C) Computation Architecture (EnergyRiskIQ-native)
Layer 1 — Event ingestion

RSS/news ingestion → ingestions

Structured storage/market ingestion (daily) → signals_daily

Layer 2 — Alert generation (you already have)

Each news item becomes an alert with:

region=Europe

theme=gas

category={energy, geopolitical, policy, market}

severity, confidence

extracted entities (country, asset, terminal, pipeline, hub)

Layer 3 — Pillar aggregators (daily)

Compute 5 pillar scores per day (0–1), then EGSI-S.

Recommended internal objects:

egsi_s_components_daily

egsi_s_daily

Layer 4 — Explanation engine (UI/SEO)

For each pillar, attach:

top drivers (top 3 alerts + top structured signals)

interpretation line (1–2 sentences)

D) Pillar Definitions (Practical, Implementable)
1) Supply pillar (S)

What it measures: EU supply fragility from outages/disruptions.

Inputs:

HighImpactSupplyAlerts (count weighted by severity*confidence)

AffectedSupplyPercent (if you can estimate; else proxy by “major asset impacted”)

Example implementation (your earlier concept):

S = clamp01(0.6*HighImpactSupplyAlerts_norm + 0.4*AffectedSupplyPercent_norm)


How to build HighImpactSupplyAlerts_norm:

Filter alerts: theme=gas AND (lng OR norway OR algeria OR pipeline OR production OR outage)

Score each: alert_score = severity * confidence * source_weight

Daily sum → normalize with rolling window (e.g., 90d min/max or robust percentile)

2) Transit/Geopolitical pillar (T)

Measures: transit corridor risk (Ukraine, Black Sea, Turkey, Middle East LNG lanes).

T = clamp01(0.5*TransitAlertCount_norm + 0.5*GeoSeverityMean_norm)


TransitAlertCount_norm: alerts tagged with route/corridor entities

GeoSeverityMean_norm: average severity*confidence of those alerts

3) Storage pillar (G)

Measures: storage below seasonal norm + refill underperformance.

Let:

D = max(0, (SeasonalNorm - CurrentStorageLevel) / SeasonalNorm)

V = max(0, (ExpectedRefillRate - ActualRefillRate) / ExpectedRefillRate)

G = clamp01(0.7*D + 0.3*V)


Winter deviation risk (your key input):

Add as an overlay factor to storage, not a separate pillar (cleaner):

WinterRisk_norm derived from weather outlook anomalies + policy warnings + “cold snap” alert pressure

then:

G = clamp01(0.65*D + 0.25*V + 0.10*WinterRisk_norm)
If you don’t have weather yet, you can proxy WinterRisk from news alerts for now.

4) Market pillar (M)

Measures: market stress (vol + shock).

M = clamp01(0.6*Volatility_norm + 0.4*PriceShock_norm)


Volatility_norm: realized volatility of TTF (rolling 7d/14d)

PriceShock_norm: magnitude of daily move vs historical distribution

5) Policy pillar (P)

Measures: intervention risk (caps, emergency measures, rationing talk).

P = clamp01(0.6*EmergencyPolicyCount_norm + 0.4*MarketInterventionSeverity_norm)

EGSI-M (Market/Transmission) — “RERI-Anchored Gas Market Stress”

Purpose: Measure gas market stress transmission inside your risk ecosystem.
Audience: traders, market watchers, anyone already using RERI/GERI.

Your formula:

EGSI_M = 100 * clamp(
  0.35*(RERI_EU/100) +
  0.35*ThemePressure_EU_Gas_norm +
  0.20*AssetTransmission_EU_Gas_norm +
  0.10*ChokepointFactor_EU_Gas_norm
)

A) Conceptual Model

EGSI-M is “gas stress as a function of”:

broader Europe risk regime (RERI_EU)

gas-specific pressure (ThemePressure)

how strongly that pressure transmits into gas asset (AssetTransmission)

chokepoint / corridor amplification (ChokepointFactor)

It’s fast, alert-driven, and doesn’t require structured storage data to launch.

B) What Each Component Means (and how to compute it)
1) Anchor: RERI_EU

Use your existing daily reri_eu (0–100)

This gives regime context: “Europe already risky → gas stress amplifies”

2) ThemePressure_EU_Gas_norm

Definition: How intense are “gas-related” alerts today in Europe?

Implementation:

Filter alerts: region=Europe AND theme=gas

Compute weighted sum:

pressure_raw = Σ(severity * confidence * freshness_weight * source_weight)

Normalize with rolling window → ThemePressure_norm in 0–1

3) AssetTransmission_EU_Gas_norm

Definition: How strongly do today’s Europe alerts imply a gas impact?

Implementation idea (clean + consistent with your engine):

For each EU alert (not only gas alerts), compute:

impact_prob_gas from your classifier (0–1)

impact_score = severity*confidence*impact_prob_gas

Sum daily, normalize:

high means “non-gas events are still bleeding into gas risk”

This is what makes EGSI-M “market transmission,” not just “gas headlines volume.”

4) ChokepointFactor_EU_Gas_norm

Definition: Are key corridors/infra nodes implicated today?

Corridor entity list (start minimal):

Ukraine transit, TurkStream/Black Sea, LNG terminals (names), Norway pipelines, Algeria/Med pipelines

Compute:

choke_raw = Σ(severity*confidence) for alerts mentioning chokepoint entities

Normalize 0–1

C) EGSI-M Output

EGSI-M number + band + trend

“Top Gas Transmission Drivers” (top 3 alerts by impact_score)

small badges:

“Regime: RERI_EU high”

“Transmission: strong/weak”

“Chokepoint: active/quiet”

Differentiation: EGSI-S vs EGSI-M

Here’s the real difference in one view:

1) What they measure

EGSI-S (System): physical + structural stress (storage/refill/winter readiness + supply + policy + market)

EGSI-M (Market): risk-signal transmission into gas (news/alerts regime + transmission + chokepoints)

2) Data dependency

EGSI-S: needs structured storage & refill data to be truly credible

EGSI-M: can run today using your existing alerts + RERI

3) Stability vs responsiveness

EGSI-S: smoother, “stateful” (storage changes daily but not wildly)

EGSI-M: reactive, can spike hard on breaking events

4) Credibility to institutions

EGSI-S: stronger for utilities/procurement/institutional licensing

EGSI-M: stronger for traders / “market regime” watchers

5) SEO angle

EGSI-S: great for “EU gas storage stress / winter readiness” keywords

EGSI-M: great for “gas risk index today / breaking risk” keywords

6) Product fit inside EnergyRiskIQ

EGSI-M: “child index” of your alert engine + RERI stack

EGSI-S: “flagship system index” that can stand alone publicly

Which one should you implement first?

Implement EGSI-M first. ✅

Why (practical + strategic):

You can ship it immediately with your current alert pipeline + RERI_EU.

It creates a gas-branded index fast (marketing + homepage card + daily cadence).

It gives you daily history accumulation now, which is priceless.

EGSI-S becomes your “v2 premium” once you ingest structured storage/refill/winter inputs reliably.

Recommended rollout plan
Phase 1 (now): EGSI-M

Compute daily

Publish delayed on homepage

Show drivers + chokepoint badge

Start accumulating history

Phase 2 (next): EGSI-S “System”

Add structured storage/refill pipeline

Add winter deviation risk proxy (weather or model)

Launch as “EGSI System Edition” for Pro + API

Result: you end up with two indices that don’t cannibalize each other:

EGSI-M = “today’s stress signal”

EGSI-S = “system condition / winter readiness”
