🧠 Strategic Advice (Very Important for Your Architecture)

This is where EnergyRiskIQ can become much stronger than a simple news aggregator.

1️⃣ Tag each source by “Signal Type”

In your ingestion DB, add:

signal_type:

policy

market

conflict

infrastructure

shipping

regulation

This later enables:

Risk scoring by signal class

User alert filters by risk type

2️⃣ Weight Sources by Credibility & Impact

Example:

Source	Weight
Reuters	1.0 (highest)
EU Commission	1.0
S&P Platts	0.9
Al Jazeera	0.7
Blogs / niche	0.4–0.6

Later your AI can compute:

Risk Score = Impact × Source Weight × Topic Sensitivity


This is exactly what institutional platforms do.

3️⃣ Region Coverage Gaps (Important)

Right now you are weak in:

🇷🇺 Russia / Ukraine official feeds

🇨🇳 China energy policy

🇲🇪 Middle East oil ministries

You may later add:

Russian Energy Ministry (English RSS if available)

China NDRC Energy news

Saudi Aramco news feed

QatarEnergy press feed

These are extremely valuable for traders.
