What other Parts of the EnergyRiskIQ Application should the Bot have access to, for maximum efficiency?

Excellent — this is exactly the right systems-thinking question.
If ERIQ Analyst only reads indices + alerts, it will be good.
If it can access the right additional application components, it becomes:

👉 A daily decision-support analyst
👉 A retention engine
👉 A conversion engine
👉 A product intelligence engine
👉 A future enterprise sales driver

Below is the complete institutional-grade access map — optimized specifically for EnergyRiskIQ architecture.

🧠 Golden Design Principle

ERIQ Analyst should access:

✅ Intelligence layers
✅ Interpretation layers
✅ User context layers
✅ Historical learning layers
✅ Product usage layers

But never raw ingestion or proprietary formula cores.

⭐ CORE ACCESS DOMAINS

(For Maximum Efficiency + Differentiation)

1️⃣ Index Engine Outputs

(You already expected this — but it must be rich)

ERIQ Should Access:

Current index values

Historical index series

Pillar contributions

Change drivers (delta attribution)

Regime classification outputs

Probability engine outputs

Divergence residual outputs

Why This Is Critical

Allows ERIQ to answer:

• Why index moved
• How unusual the move is
• Whether it signals regime shift
• Cross-index relationships

2️⃣ Alert Intelligence System

(This is one of your strongest differentiators)

ERIQ Should Access:

Alert summaries

Alert severity scores

Alert category tags

Alert → pillar mappings

Alert persistence/decay metadata

Alert clustering results (if available)

Enables ERIQ To:

Explain:
👉 “Which events actually drove risk”
👉 “Why headlines may no longer matter”
👉 “Which signals are noise vs structural”

3️⃣ Asset Intelligence Layer

(Transforms ERIQ from research tool → trading intelligence)

ERIQ Should Access:

Asset snapshots (Brent, TTF, VIX, FX, storage)

Rolling correlations/betas

Divergence detection outputs

Regime-conditioned asset sensitivity

Asset volatility context

Enables ERIQ To:

Translate:
👉 Risk → Market implication
👉 Risk vs asset disagreement
👉 Probabilistic asset pressure narratives

This dramatically increases:
👉 Trader plan conversion

4️⃣ Historical Event & Index Memory Layer

(Massive intelligence multiplier)

ERIQ Should Access:

Historical high-risk periods

Similar pattern detection

Past alert clusters

Historical regime transitions

Historical asset reactions

Enables ERIQ To:

Answer:
👉 “When did we last see this pattern?”
👉 “How did markets react historically?”
👉 “Is this escalation typical?”

This makes ERIQ feel:
👉 Senior analyst-level

5️⃣ User Personalization Layer

(Underrated but extremely powerful)

ERIQ Should Access:

User subscription plan

User preferred regions/assets

Saved watchlists

Past bot conversations

User behavior patterns

Organization portfolios (Enterprise)

Enables ERIQ To:

Provide:
👉 Personalized interpretations
👉 Portfolio-aware narratives
👉 Region-specific summaries
👉 Smart follow-up questions

This massively improves:
👉 Retention
👉 Enterprise stickiness

6️⃣ Daily Digest Intelligence System

(Your engagement engine)

ERIQ Should Access:

Digest summaries

Narrative structure

Highlighted risk drivers

Editorial commentary tags

Digest-to-index linking

Enables ERIQ To:

Expand digest analysis

Translate digest into scenarios

Generate custom briefs

Explain editorial reasoning

This dramatically improves:
👉 Daily login habit formation

7️⃣ Methodology & Knowledge Base (RAG)

(The brain of ERIQ)

ERIQ Must Access:

GERI methodology

EERI methodology

EGSI methodology

Glossary

Interpretation playbook

FAQ

Compliance rules

Enables ERIQ To:

Teach users

Prevent hallucinations

Maintain brand authority

Reduce support load

8️⃣ Model Confidence & Data Quality Layer

(Enterprise trust booster)

ERIQ Should Access:

Feed completeness indicators

Confidence scores

Model uncertainty markers

Missing data flags

Outlier detection outputs

Enables ERIQ To:

Say:
👉 “Confidence is reduced today because storage data is incomplete.”

Enterprise clients LOVE this transparency.

9️⃣ Plan Entitlement & Monetization Engine

(Revenue-critical)

ERIQ Should Access:

Feature entitlements

Usage quotas

Upgrade eligibility

Feature lock metadata

Enables ERIQ To:

Tailor answers per plan

Trigger upgrades naturally

Avoid accidental data leakage

🔟 Product Analytics & Feedback Layer

(Secret weapon most SaaS ignore)

ERIQ Should Access:

Most asked questions

Failed interpretations

User feedback tags

Feature usage patterns

Enables ERIQ To:

Improve itself AND guide product roadmap.

⭐ BONUS ACCESS (Advanced — Huge Future Value)
1️⃣1️⃣ Scenario Simulation Engine (Future Gold)

If implemented later:

ERIQ could:

Run “what if” simulations

Stress-test alert escalations

Forecast regime probabilities

Enterprise clients pay heavily for this.

1️⃣2️⃣ Content Generation & Reporting Layer

ERIQ could auto-create:

Executive briefs

Trading briefs

Risk committee summaries

Weekly geopolitical outlooks

1️⃣3️⃣ Cross-Index Interaction Models

Enables:

👉 “EGSI spike increases probability of EERI escalation by X%”

Huge differentiation feature.

🚫 What ERIQ SHOULD NEVER Access Directly

For security and IP protection:

❌ Raw ingestion feeds
❌ Raw scoring algorithms
❌ Internal weighting formulas
❌ Other users’ sensitive data
❌ Admin debugging systems
❌ Pre-validation model outputs
