Below is a complete strategic + UX + feature segmentation design.

✅ PART 1 — Evaluation of Your Current EERI Pro Dashboard

You already have a VERY strong structure. Let me give a professional product evaluation.

👍 Strengths
1️⃣ Clear Hierarchical Risk Presentation

You correctly start with:

Real-time index card

Component breakdown

Asset stress panel

This matches how institutional desks think.

2️⃣ Excellent Explainability Layer

Your:

Top Drivers module

Component transparency

Historical intelligence

Regime statistics

These are premium-grade features. Very rare.

3️⃣ Proper Multi-Scale Risk View

You cover:

Instant risk state

Structural history

Driver analysis

Market exposure

This is exactly how professional risk intelligence tools operate.

⚠️ Missing Piece (Strategically Important)

You currently lack:

👉 A mid-timeframe interpretive layer

You have:

Daily interpretation

Historical analytics

You DO NOT have:

Weekly intelligence summary

That gap is what the Weekly Snapshot fills.

🧭 PART 2 — Where Weekly Snapshot Should Live (By Plan)

WHY This Placement Is PERFECT

This is a natural cognitive bridge.
