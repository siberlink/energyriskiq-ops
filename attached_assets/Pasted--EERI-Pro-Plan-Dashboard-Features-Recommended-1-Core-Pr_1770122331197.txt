🔒 EERI — Pro Plan Dashboard Features (Recommended)
1️⃣ Core Pro Charts (the backbone)

These are must-have and exactly what you suggested — you’re spot on.

📈 Correlation & Overlay Charts

Each chart should allow overlay + toggle + zoom.

EERI vs Brent Crude

Spot regime shifts (risk → oil response lag)

EERI vs TTF Gas

Europe-specific stress signal (very strong value)

EERI vs European Gas (front-month)

EERI vs VIX

Macro risk vs energy-specific divergence

EERI vs Freight Index

Supply-chain & logistics transmission

💡 Pro insight:
Most platforms show price → risk.
You show risk → price.

2️⃣ Advanced Time Controls (Pro-only)

Give users control, not just charts.

Time ranges:

7D / 30D / 90D / Since Launch

Toggle:

Index only

Asset only

Overlay mode

Smoothing:

Raw

3-day MA

7-day MA

This makes the dashboard feel analyst-grade, not retail.

3️⃣ Component Transparency (Pro-exclusive)

This is where Pro really earns its price.

🧠 EERI Component Breakdown

Show normalized values only (never raw):

RERI_EU contribution

Theme Pressure

Asset Transmission

(Later) Contagion

Visualize as:

Stacked bar

Donut

Waterfall

➡️ Users see why today is 83, not just that it is.

4️⃣ Asset Stress Panel (Highly Valuable)

A compact but powerful module.

Asset Stress Snapshot

Gas → High

Oil → Elevated

Freight → Severe

FX → Elevated

Optional:

Directional bias (↑ ↓ ~)

Color-coded risk bands

This is extremely attractive to traders and analysts.

5️⃣ Top Drivers — Full Version (Pro)

Public sees 2–3 headlines.
Pro sees the real engine.

For each driver:

Headline

Driver class (high impact / spike)

Theme (geopolitical, energy, supply chain)

Severity

Confidence

Assets affected

Sort by:

Severity

Confidence

Asset overlap

This is decision support, not news.

6️⃣ Historical Intelligence (Pro-only)

This is one of your strongest moats.

📊 Historical Views

EERI history (daily)

Risk band history (% of time in CRITICAL, HIGH, etc.)

Compare:

This week vs last week

This month vs last month

Optional advanced view:

“Last time EERI ≥ 80, what happened next?”

7️⃣ Alerts & Thresholds (Pro)

Let users interact with the index.

Notify when:

EERI crosses 60 / 70 / 80

Sharp day-over-day change (Δ ≥ X)

Delivery:

In-app

Email

Telegram (later)

This alone justifies a monthly subscription.

8️⃣ Daily EERI Intelligence Summary (Pro)

A daily auto-generated brief, tied to the index value.

Example:

“EERI closed at 83 (CRITICAL), driven by war escalation and aviation disruption. Gas and freight remain the most exposed assets. Risk remains elevated compared to the 30-day baseline.”

This is:

Shareable

Sticky

High perceived value

Cheap to generate (you already have the data)

🧩 Optional (but very powerful) Pro Add-Ons

Add later if you want to scale pricing tiers.

🔍 EERI vs GERI comparison

🌍 EERI vs Middle East RERI (when available)

🧠 “What changed since yesterday?” delta view

📤 CSV / API export (Enterprise tier)

🏁 Minimal Pro Feature Set (if you want to start lean)

If you want the tightest possible Pro v1, do this:

✅ EERI vs Brent
✅ EERI vs TTF Gas
✅ EERI vs VIX
✅ EERI vs Freight
✅ Component Breakdown
✅ Top Drivers (full)
✅ Historical chart
✅ Daily summary text

That alone is absolutely worth $49/month.

💡 Strategic Pricing Insight (important)

What you’re offering is not data — it’s:

Context

Interpretation

Early signal

Cross-asset intelligence

Most users cannot build this themselves.

Your Pro dashboard should feel like:

“I can’t afford not to check this every day.”

If you want, next I can:
