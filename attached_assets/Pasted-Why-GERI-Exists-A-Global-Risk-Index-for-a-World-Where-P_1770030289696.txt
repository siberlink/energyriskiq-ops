Why GERI Exists
A Global Risk Index for a World Where Prices React Faster Than Reality

Markets move fast.
Headlines move faster.

But systemic risk—the kind that actually affects energy, supply chains, and capital—moves differently.

That’s why we built GERI.

GERI (Global Energy Risk Index) is not a price, not a forecast, and not a headline feed.
It is a daily risk regime signal that tells you whether global geopolitical and energy stress is building, peaking, or dissipating—before or after markets react.

The Problem With Watching Prices Alone

Oil spikes.
Gas crashes.
Volatility explodes.
Freight surges.

Every day, markets shout:

“Something is happening!”

But they don’t answer the question that matters most:

Is this real systemic risk—or just short-term noise?

Prices react instantly.
Risk accumulates gradually.

Confusing the two leads to:

over-trading

premature de-risking

missed regime shifts

false confidence when volatility fades

GERI was built to solve this gap.

What GERI Actually Measures

GERI aggregates global geopolitical and energy stress signals into a single, interpretable daily score (0–100), updated every day.

It reflects:

escalation intensity

regional concentration of risk

asset exposure pressure (oil, gas, freight)

persistence, not panic

GERI doesn’t chase markets.
It measures whether stress is becoming structural.

Why GERI Looks Different From Oil, Gas, VIX, and Freight

This is where GERI proves its value.

Oil Moves First. GERI Confirms (or Rejects).

Oil prices react quickly to headlines and sentiment.
GERI rises only when those moves are supported by sustained geopolitical or energy pressure.

If oil spikes but GERI stays stable, that tells you something important:

The market may be overreacting.

If oil pulls back but GERI remains elevated:

Risk hasn’t actually gone away.

Gas Is Local. GERI Is Global.

European gas prices are volatile by nature.
They reflect regional stress, infrastructure constraints, and short-term flows.

GERI filters this:

Local panic stays local

Only contagious, cross-regional risk moves the index

That distinction is critical for anyone managing exposure beyond a single market.

VIX Measures Fear. GERI Measures Pressure.

Volatility spikes fast—and collapses just as fast.

GERI behaves differently:

it rises more slowly

it peaks later

it stays elevated longer

This is intentional.

GERI reflects structural pressure, not emotional market reactions.
It often remains elevated after volatility fades, when risks still exist but markets feel calm again.

That’s where most mistakes happen.

Freight Breaks First. GERI Tells You If It Matters.

Freight reacts instantly to disruption.
GERI tells you whether that disruption is temporary or systemic.

Not every shipping shock becomes a global risk event.
GERI highlights the ones that do.

The Pattern Professionals Care About

Across oil, gas, volatility, and freight, one pattern repeats:

Markets react first.
GERI moves later—but more reliably.

That makes GERI ideal for:

risk regime identification

confirmation or rejection of market moves

avoiding overreaction

explaining decisions to stakeholders

GERI doesn’t compete with prices.
It puts them in context.
