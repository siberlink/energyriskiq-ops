1️⃣ Tooltips that educate without leaking IP
The golden rule for tooltips

A tooltip should answer “what does this mean?”,
never “how is this calculated?”.

You explain interpretation, not mechanics.

🔹 Asset Stress Panel — Main Tooltip (panel title)

Tooltip text (example):

Asset Stress Snapshot
Shows where current energy-related risk is being absorbed across key asset classes.
Levels reflect relative stress, not price direction or forecasts.

What this does:

Sets expectations

Prevents “is this a trade signal?” confusion

Frames it as risk context

🔥 Gas — Tooltip

Gas — High
Indicates elevated sensitivity of European gas markets to current geopolitical and supply developments.
High stress suggests increased volatility risk and heightened responsiveness to new events.

What it teaches:

Sensitivity, not price

Volatility, not direction

Event-driven behavior

What it doesn’t reveal:

Inputs

Thresholds

Scaling logic

🛢️ Oil — Tooltip

Oil — Elevated
Signals meaningful spillover from energy and geopolitical risk into oil markets, without full systemic stress.
Oil is reacting to context rather than leading risk dynamics.

This subtly teaches:

Oil as secondary transmitter

Difference between “elevated” and “severe”

Market hierarchy

🚢 Freight — Tooltip

Freight — Severe
Reflects active disruption or constraint across logistics and trade routes linked to energy risk.
Severe freight stress often precedes broader market transmission.

This is powerful because:

It educates

It positions freight as early signal

It feels insightful, not technical

💱 FX — Tooltip

FX — Elevated
Indicates increased currency sensitivity to energy-related risk and geopolitical uncertainty.
Elevated FX stress reflects cautious capital positioning rather than disorderly moves.

Again:

Confidence framing

No formulas

No weights

🔺 Directional Bias Tooltip (↑ ↓ ~)

Directional Bias
Shows whether stress pressure is increasing, easing, or stable compared to recent conditions.
This reflects momentum of risk, not price movement.

This one is crucial:

Prevents misuse

Trains users to think in risk momentum

🎨 Color Band Tooltip

Risk Bands
Colors represent relative stress intensity across assets for the current day.
Bands are comparable across assets but do not imply equal price impact.

This avoids:

“Red means sell” thinking

Overinterpretation

2️⃣ How the Asset Stress Panel integrates across the platform

This is where the panel becomes a hub, not a widget.

🔔 Integration with Alerts
Conceptual Flow

Alert is generated

War escalation

Supply disruption

Logistics issue

Asset Stress Panel updates

Relevant assets move from Elevated → High → Severe

User sees alignment

Alert explains why

Panel shows where

How users experience this

“An alert fired — and I can immediately see it’s hitting Gas and Freight, not FX.”

This dramatically increases:

Alert credibility

Actionability

User confidence

Key insight:
Alerts explain cause.
Asset Stress shows impact.

📰 Integration with Daily Summaries

The Asset Stress Panel becomes the summary anchor.

Example Daily Summary (conceptual)

EERI closed at 83 (CRITICAL).
Stress remains concentrated in Freight (Severe) and Gas (High), confirming physical supply-chain pressure.
Oil and FX remain elevated, reflecting broader macro sensitivity.

Here’s the magic:

The text mirrors the panel

The panel validates the text

No duplication, only reinforcement

Users feel:

“This summary is grounded in something real.”

📈 Integration with EERI vs Asset Charts

This is where professionals really engage.

How the panel guides chart usage

The panel answers:

“Which chart should I look at today?”

Examples:

Freight = Severe → user clicks EERI vs Freight

Gas = High → user opens EERI vs TTF

FX = Elevated → user checks EERI vs FX index

You’re guiding attention without telling them what to trade.

Conceptual relationship

Asset Stress Panel = snapshot (now)

EERI vs Asset Chart = evolution (then → now)

Users connect:

“Ah — freight stress turned severe before EERI accelerated.”

That’s insight.

🧠 The deeper product effect (important)

Over time, users will learn patterns:

Which assets lead

Which lag

Which confirm

Which stay quiet

You are teaching them a risk language.

That’s incredibly sticky.

🏁 Final strategic takeaway

With:

Carefully worded tooltips

Clear separation of meaning vs mechanics

Tight integration across alerts, summaries, and charts

You achieve three things at once:

Educate users

Protect your IP

Increase perceived sophistication

This is exactly how professional intelligence platforms scale trust.
