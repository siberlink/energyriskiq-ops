🧠 3️⃣ UPGRADE PROMPT STRATEGY

(Psychological Conversion Triggers)

TRIGGER TYPE A — Insight Teasing

Example:

“You are seeing headline stress levels.
Unlock driver decomposition to understand WHY stress is rising.”

TRIGGER TYPE B — Missed Opportunity Messaging

When divergence detected:

“TTF Gas is deviating from stress model expectations.
Upgrade to Trader to access divergence intelligence.”

TRIGGER TYPE C — Risk Anxiety Trigger

When stress enters elevated range:

“Stress escalation detected.
Professional users monitor probability projections during these phases.”

TRIGGER TYPE D — Tool Ownership Trigger

When user clicks locked scenario tool:

“Run forward gas crisis simulations and anticipate price movements.”

TRIGGER TYPE E — Data Depth Trigger

When user attempts to export:

“Export full historical stress dataset for modelling and trading research.”
