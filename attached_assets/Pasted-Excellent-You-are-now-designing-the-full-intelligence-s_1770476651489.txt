Excellent. You are now designing the full intelligence stack behind GERI. What you’re asking for is essentially:

👉 Event Ontology
👉 Regime Detection Engine
👉 Predictive Market Reaction Model
👉 AI Signal Cleaning Architecture

This is institutional-grade index design. Below is a clean, conceptual + formula-based blueprint you can hand to Replit AI later for implementation.

🧠 PART 1 — GERI EVENT TAXONOMY SYSTEM

(Classifies ALL energy risk events)

This is your foundation layer. Everything else depends on it.

⭐ PURPOSE

Event taxonomy allows GERI to:

✔ Score risk consistently
✔ Train AI classification
✔ Measure transmission patterns
✔ Enable explainability

⭐ LEVEL 1 — PRIMARY EVENT DOMAINS

Every event MUST belong to one of these.

🟥 SUPPLY DISRUPTION EVENTS

Physical energy availability threats.

Subcategories
Pipeline disruption
Production outage
Sanctions on producers
Export restrictions
Infrastructure sabotage
Weather-related production loss
Labor strikes

🟦 TRANSIT & LOGISTICS EVENTS

Energy transportation risks.

Subcategories
Chokepoint security threat
Shipping attack
Canal blockage
Port congestion
Maritime insurance shock
Freight surge

🟩 DEMAND SHOCK EVENTS

Consumption or industrial energy demand changes.

Subcategories
Industrial slowdown
Economic stimulus
Fuel substitution policy
Strategic reserve usage
Seasonal demand anomaly

🟨 POLICY & REGULATORY EVENTS

Government interventions affecting energy markets.

Subcategories
OPEC production decision
Energy export restrictions
Sanctions policy expansion
Environmental regulation
Tax / subsidy changes
Strategic alliances

🟪 GEOPOLITICAL / MILITARY ESCALATION

Conflict-driven risk.

Subcategories
Military strike
War escalation
Regional armed conflict
Terror attack
Diplomatic breakdown

🟧 STRUCTURAL ENERGY TRANSITION EVENTS

Long-term systemic risk.

Subcategories
Grid instability
Renewables intermittency
Critical minerals shortage
Infrastructure modernization failure

⭐ LEVEL 2 — EVENT ATTRIBUTES

Each event must carry:

EventDomain
RegionCluster
SeverityLevel
PersistenceType
DirectEnergyImpact
TransmissionType

⭐ LEVEL 3 — SEVERITY SCORING TEMPLATE
EventSeverity =
PhysicalImpactScore
+ MarketPsychologyScore
+ DurationExpectationScore


Each scored 0–1 and weighted.

🌡 PART 2 — RISK REGIME CLASSIFICATION ENGINE

Defines macro energy market states.

⭐ REGIME TYPES
🟢 NORMAL REGIME
GERI < 35
Low volatility
Stable supply/demand balance

🟡 TENSION REGIME
GERI 35–55
Localized disruptions
Market sensitive but stable

🟠 CRISIS REGIME
GERI 55–75
Multiple risk drivers
Supply uncertainty
Freight & gas react strongly

🔴 WAR SHOCK REGIME
GERI > 75
Active military or systemic conflict
Cross-asset volatility
Severe supply uncertainty

🔵 STABILIZATION REGIME
GERI declining after crisis
Markets remain volatile but normalizing

⭐ REGIME DETECTION FORMULA
RegimeScore =
GERI_Level
+ MomentumFactor
+ RegionalConcentrationFactor
+ ContagionScore

MomentumFactor

Measures acceleration of risk.

RegionalConcentrationFactor

Measures if risk originates from one or multiple clusters.

ContagionScore

Measures cross-asset confirmation.

⭐ REGIME TRANSITION LOGIC
If GERI increases AND momentum rising → Escalation regime
If GERI decreases BUT volatility remains → Stabilization regime

📊 PART 3 — CROSS-ASSET PREDICTIVE PROBABILITY MODEL

Predicts how markets respond to events.

⭐ MODEL GOAL

Estimate probability:

P(Asset Move | Event Type + Regime + Region)

⭐ MODEL STRUCTURE
STEP 1 — Event Feature Vector
EventVector =
{
EventDomain
RegionCluster
Severity
Persistence
RegimeState
}

STEP 2 — Asset Sensitivity Matrix

Predefined sensitivity scores:

Example:

Asset	Supply Events	Transit	Demand	Policy	War
Brent	0.9	0.7	0.6	0.8	0.9
TTF	0.8	0.6	0.5	0.7	0.7
VIX	0.6	0.5	0.4	0.7	0.9
STEP 3 — Probability Function
ProbabilityMove =
Sigmoid(
EventSeverity
* AssetSensitivity
* RegimeAmplifier
* HistoricalResponseFactor
)

⭐ OUTPUT TYPES
ProbabilityLargeMove
ProbabilityVolatilitySpike
ProbabilityLaggedResponse

⭐ HISTORICAL RESPONSE FACTOR

Uses rolling historical reaction:

ResponseFactor =
ObservedAssetMoveAfterSimilarEvents

🧹 PART 4 — NEWS DEDUPLICATION & SIGNAL SCORING AI DESIGN

Critical once sources expand.

⭐ PROBLEM

Multiple sources often report:

👉 Same event
👉 Slightly different wording
👉 At different times

If untreated → artificial risk inflation.

⭐ SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE
STEP 1 — Semantic Event Clustering

Use NLP embeddings to group articles.

Cluster if similarity > threshold

STEP 2 — Source Credibility Weighting

Each source gets:

CredibilityScore =
HistoricalAccuracy
+ SourceAuthority
+ ReportingSpeed

STEP 3 — Event Confidence Score
Confidence =
NumberOfIndependentSources
* AverageCredibility
* ContentConsistency

STEP 4 — Temporal Deduplication

If multiple articles occur within time window:

Merge into single EventObject

STEP 5 — Signal Amplification Guard

Prevent overcounting:

If EventClusterDetected:
Apply diminishing returns function

⭐ EVENT CLUSTERING OUTPUT OBJECT
EventCluster {
PrimaryEventSummary
Region
Domain
SeverityScore
ConfidenceScore
SourceList
Timestamp
}

⭐ ADVANCED FEATURE — AI EVENT SUMMARIZATION

Each cluster generates:

AI Risk Summary
Impact Expectation
Affected Assets
Confidence Level

⭐ SIGNAL QUALITY INDEX

(New internal metric)

Measures:

SignalQuality =
ConfidenceScore
* SourceDiversity
* HistoricalAccuracyAlignment

⭐ HOW ALL FOUR SYSTEMS WORK TOGETHER
News → Deduplication → Taxonomy → Severity Scoring → Regime Detection → Asset Prediction → GERI Calculation

⭐ STRATEGIC POWER OF THIS ARCHITECTURE

You are building:

👉 A global energy risk ontology
👉 A dynamic market regime detector
👉 A predictive asset behavior engine
👉 A self-cleaning news intelligence system

That combination is extremely rare.

⭐ REALITY CHECK

If you implement this stack, GERI becomes:

Closer to institutional geopolitical risk models than typical SaaS dashboards.
