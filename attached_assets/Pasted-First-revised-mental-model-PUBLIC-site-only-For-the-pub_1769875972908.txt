First: revised mental model (PUBLIC site only)

For the public side of EnergyRiskIQ, your structure is effectively:

Index Pages (GERI / EERI / EGSI)
   ↑
Index History Pages
   ↑
Alert History Pages (snapshots only, public)


There is no deeper alert layer publicly — and that’s fine.

So we concentrate authority upward, not downward.

Key Principle (this is the anchor)

Alert History pages explain WHY an index moved.
Index pages explain WHAT the risk level is.

Alerts support indices.
Indices are the SEO targets.

🔹 Alert HISTORY pages (12–25 snapshots, public)
What these pages are (SEO-wise)

supporting evidence

temporal context

risk narrative

They should NOT act like article hubs.

✅ Correct contextual linking from Alert History → Indexes
1️⃣ ONE “Risk Context” block per page (mandatory)

Place it above or below the alert list (not inside each alert).

Example:

Risk Context

The alerts on this page contributed to elevated readings in:

Global Energy Risk Index (GERI)

Europe Energy Risk Index (EERI)

reflecting heightened geopolitical and energy-market stress during this period.

🔢 How many links?

✔ 2–3 index links TOTAL per Alert History page

Always: GERI

Conditional: EERI / EGSI (only if clearly relevant)

Never more.

2️⃣ Optional inline reference (MAX 1)

If you include a short intro paragraph, you may add one inline link:

“Several of these events fed into regional risk calculations tracked by the Europe Energy Risk Index.”

That’s it. No more.

❌ What NOT to do on Alert History pages

❌ no per-alert index links

❌ no repeated index names in every snapshot

❌ no “related indices” under each alert

That would look mechanical.

🔹 Individual alert SNAPSHOTS (inside history pages)

Each snapshot should:

link to nothing

or optionally link to:

the user login / upgrade (non-SEO)

SEO-wise, snapshots are content blocks, not link sources.

This is correct.

🔹 Index pages (GERI / EERI / EGSI) — MOST IMPORTANT

Because you don’t have public full alert pages, index pages must:

summarize alert impact

reference alert history pages sparingly

stay authoritative, not archival

1️⃣ “Recent Risk Drivers” block (safe version)

Instead of linking to individual alerts, do this:

Recent Risk Drivers

Escalating Middle East tensions impacting oil markets

Elevated European gas supply stress

Strategic crude stockpiling affecting global prices

(Based on recent EnergyRiskIQ alerts)

OPTIONAL (recommended):

Link once to the relevant Alert History page, not per item.

✔ This keeps index pages clean and avoids thin-content risk.

🔢 How many links (Index → Alert History)

✔ 1–2 links MAX per index page

Link to:

“Europe Alerts – January 2026”

or “Global Alerts – Recent”

Never more.

🔹 Index HISTORY pages

These are time-series views, not content hubs.

Safe pattern:

1 link back to the main index

1 optional link to the matching alert history page for that period

✔ 2 links total

Nothing else.

🔢 Final Numbers (clear & implementable)
Alert History Page

→ Indexes: 2–3 links total

→ Alerts: none (snapshots only)

Index Page

→ Alert History pages: 1–2 links

→ Other indices: 0–2 max

Index History Page

→ Index: 1

→ Alert History: 0–1

Why this works (even without full alert pages)

Google sees:

Alert history pages = supporting datasets

Index pages = authoritative outcomes

Clear hierarchy

No link spam

No artificial loops

Most importantly:

Authority always flows UP to the indices

Which is exactly what you want to rank.

Strategic bonus (this is powerful)

Because alerts are paywalled in full, you can safely add this line to public pages:

Detailed alert analysis is available to registered EnergyRiskIQ users.

This:

explains content limitation

improves trust

avoids “thin content” penalties

Final reassurance

You are not missing anything by keeping full alerts private.
In fact, this setup:

protects your IP

keeps SEO clean

makes indices the star

mirrors how professional risk platforms operate
