👉 The way you VISUALIZE + INTERPRET asset data against GERI is what transforms you from “data dashboard” into “decision intelligence platform”.

You already have a MASSIVE advantage:

Full lifecycle historical data

Multi-asset macro coverage

Risk index (GERI) that acts as anchor signal

So below is a best-in-class concept framework that institutional dashboards use, adapted specifically for GERI.

🧠 Core Philosophy
GERI is NOT another asset

GERI is the risk thermometer.

Assets are the market reaction.

Your chart system must visually answer:

👉 Is risk rising?
👉 Which asset reacts first?
👉 Which asset overreacts?
👉 Which asset ignores risk?
👉 Are we entering systemic stress?

🧭 Master Chart Concept
The “Risk → Market Response Framework”

Every chart must show 3 layers simultaneously:

Layer 1 — Risk Signal (GERI)

The anchor.

Layer 2 — Asset Response

The observable market reaction.

Layer 3 — Interpretation Overlay

Automated explanation.

📊 Chart Architecture (BEST CONCEPT)
1️⃣ Unified Overlay Chart (Your Primary Chart)

This is your flagship visualization.

Chart Layout
X-Axis

👉 Time (full lifecycle of GERI)

Y-Axis LEFT

👉 GERI (0–100 scale)

Always left axis.
Always normalized.
Always bold.

Y-Axis RIGHT

👉 Selected Asset Price

(Brent / TTF / VIX / EURUSD / Storage)

Visual Styling Concept
GERI

Thick line

Color-coded by risk band:

Green → Normal

Yellow → Elevated

Orange → High

Red → Severe/Critical

Assets

Thin clean lines
Different color per asset

2️⃣ Regime Highlight Bands (HUGE VALUE FEATURE)

Behind the chart, show background shading:

Risk Level	Background
Normal	very light green
Elevated	light yellow
High	light orange
Severe	red gradient

This gives instant macro interpretation without reading numbers.

3️⃣ Risk–Response Timing Markers (Your Secret Weapon)

Place markers when:

GERI leads asset movement

Example label:
"Risk signal preceded Brent move by 5 days"

Asset moves without risk confirmation

Example:
"Market volatility spike without systemic risk confirmation"

This turns your chart into:

👉 predictive intelligence
👉 not just historical overlay

4️⃣ Normalization Toggle (Critical Feature)

Users MUST be able to toggle:

Raw Price Mode

Shows actual price values

Indexed Mode (RECOMMENDED DEFAULT)

Start all lines at 100 on selected date.

This allows:

👉 pure response comparison
👉 removes price scale distortion

Institutional users LOVE this.

5️⃣ Rolling Correlation Panel

Add optional secondary mini-chart below.

Shows:

Correlation between GERI and selected asset.

Example output:

Positive correlation spike

Correlation breakdown

Regime shift signal

📊 Asset-Specific Interpretation Framework

(THIS is where your platform becomes unique)

🛢 Brent Oil — Interpretation Logic
What Brent Represents

Global energy supply expectations.

How To Interpret Brent vs GERI
Scenario A — GERI ↑ Brent ↑

Interpretation:
Supply disruption fear confirmed.

Very strong systemic signal.

Scenario B — GERI ↑ Brent flat/down

Interpretation:
Markets expect disruption to be temporary or politically contained.

Watch for delayed oil repricing.

Scenario C — Brent ↑ GERI stable

Interpretation:
Demand-driven rally or production constraints unrelated to geopolitical escalation.

🔥 TTF Gas — Interpretation Logic
What TTF Represents

European vulnerability indicator.

Most sensitive asset to geopolitical gas risk.

Scenario A — GERI ↑ TTF ↑ sharply

Interpretation:
Europe gas stress confirmed.

Often early indicator of winter energy crisis.

Scenario B — GERI ↑ TTF stable

Interpretation:
Storage buffers absorbing risk.

Europe currently protected.

Scenario C — TTF ↑ while GERI stable

Interpretation:
Localized infrastructure or weather-driven stress.

📉 VIX — Interpretation Logic
What VIX Represents

Global financial stress sentiment.

Scenario A — GERI ↑ VIX ↑

Interpretation:
Energy risk spilling into global financial markets.

Macro systemic stress signal.

Scenario B — GERI ↑ VIX flat

Interpretation:
Risk still sector-contained.

Opportunity environment.

💶 EUR/USD — Interpretation Logic
What EUR/USD Represents

Europe macro vulnerability.

Scenario A — GERI ↑ EUR ↓

Interpretation:
Capital flight from Europe.
Energy dependency risk priced in.

Scenario B — GERI ↑ EUR stable

Interpretation:
ECB / macro offsets buffering energy shock.

🛢 EU Gas Storage — Interpretation Logic

(This is your most underrated dataset.)

Storage Adds Context to Risk

Storage answers:

👉 Is Europe prepared?

Scenario A — High GERI + Low Storage

Interpretation:
Maximum vulnerability state.

Historically highest TTF volatility probability.

Scenario B — High GERI + High Storage

Interpretation:
Risk muted by buffer.

Markets often overreact early.

🧭 Lifecycle Interpretation Layer (HIGH-END FEATURE)

Divide the entire GERI history into phases:

Risk Accumulation Phase

GERI rising gradually
Assets react slowly

Shock Phase

GERI spike
Assets overshoot

Stabilization Phase

GERI falls
Assets remain volatile

Recovery Phase

GERI low
Assets normalize

Automatically label these phases on chart timeline.

🧠 Automated Interpretation Panel (Game Changer)

Next to the chart display:

1️⃣ Current Market State

Example:

"Energy risk is HIGH and accelerating.
TTF Gas is reacting strongly.
Brent is lagging risk signal.
European storage remains above seasonal average, partially offsetting risk."

2️⃣ Risk Outlook Classification

Risk Leading Markets

Markets Leading Risk

Systemic Convergence

Temporary Divergence

⭐ Multi-Asset Intelligence Mode (Pro/Enterprise)

Allow overlay of:

GERI + Brent + TTF + VIX + EUR + Storage

Then auto-generate:

👉 Systemic stress score
👉 Cross-asset confirmation rating

🧭 Time Control Concept

Offer:

7D

30D

90D

AND

Comparison Mode:
Compare two periods visually.

⭐ MOST IMPORTANT INSIGHT TO SHOW USERS

(Not enough dashboards do this.)

Show:

👉 “Risk usually leads TTF by X days historically”

👉 “Risk leads Brent by X days during high volatility regimes”

This builds:

Trust

Predictive perception

Subscription stickiness

🧠 UX Rule You MUST Follow

Never show asset data alone.

Always show asset data in risk context.

This is your entire brand identity.

⭐ Your Competitive Differentiation (Truth)

Most dashboards show:

Price → Explanation

EnergyRiskIQ shows:

Risk → Market Reaction → Forward Risk

That is extremely rare.
