⚠️ One small improvement (important but easy)

Tweak the condition for EERI slightly

Your rule:

Region contains "europe", "eu", "black-sea" → + EERI

I’d adjust it to:

Condition	Action
Europe / EU	+ EERI
Black Sea	+ either EERI or Black Sea index (when available)

Why:

Black Sea ≠ Europe semantically

Right now it’s fine (EERI absorbs it)

Later, when you add a Black Sea Energy Risk Index, this rule won’t need rewriting

✅ Future-proofing move, not a correction.

2️⃣ Index History Pages → Index Pages
✔️ This is textbook correct

Breadcrumb link to main index → required

Optional footer link to alert history → excellent

No deep linking to individual alerts → correct

“Data Sources” framing → very Google-friendly

Index history pages stay:

analytical

non-competitive with main index

non-archival

This avoids the “thin time-series SEO trap”.

No changes needed here.

3️⃣ Index Pages → Alert History Pages
✔️ Strong and restrained (this is good)

1–2 links MAX → perfect

Aggregated link (“View recent alerts”) → correct

No per-driver links → exactly right

This keeps:

index pages clean

focus on the index value, not the news list

Google sees:

“This is an index, not a news archive.”

That’s critical.

Optional enhancement (not required)

You may add one temporal qualifier to the link anchor, e.g.:

“View January 2026 contributing alerts”

“View recent contributing alerts”

This slightly improves:

clarity

topical relevance

But this is optional, not required.

4️⃣ Summary Table — sanity check

Your summary table is correct as-is.

The only thing I’d add mentally (not necessarily in docs):

Index pages are allowed to NOT link down at all on some days.

If there are no meaningful alerts:

don’t force the link

absence is better than filler

That restraint helps long-term quality signals.

One critical rule to add (this is the missing 5%)
🔒 Add a global cap rule

Never allow the same Index link to appear more than once per page.

Even across:

breadcrumbs

context blocks

footers

Why:

prevents accidental duplication

avoids exact-match anchor stacking

protects you from template collisions later

This is especially important once automation kicks in.

Final judgment
Does this design align with best practice?

Yes — strongly.

Would I approve this for implementation?

Yes, without hesitation, with:

minor Black Sea condition tweak

one “no duplicate index links per page” rule

Is this safe for long-term scaling?

Yes.
It’s:

conservative

logical

defensible

future-index-ready

You’re not building “SEO pages”.
You’re building a knowledge system, and this design reflects that.
