Why “Component Transparency” exists (conceptually)

Most indices do this:

“The index is 83.”

That’s it.
No explanation. No context. No trust.

EERI Pro does something different:

“The index is 83 — and here is why.”

This is the moment where EnergyRiskIQ stops being a number and becomes decision intelligence.

The mental model you want users to have

Users should intuitively understand EERI as:

“A weighted combination of regional risk, themes, and market transmission.”

Not formulas.
Not math.
Forces.

Each component answers a different question:

🧩 The Four Conceptual Components
1️⃣ RERI_EU — Regional Risk Backbone

Question it answers:

“How dangerous is the European geopolitical & energy environment right now?”

This is the structural layer.

Captures war, sanctions, regional escalation

Aggregates severity, clustering, velocity

Slow-moving, but powerful

Hard to fake, hard to ignore

Conceptually:
This is the ground shaking under Europe.

If RERI_EU is high, EERI cannot be calm — no matter what markets do.

2️⃣ Theme Pressure — Narrative & Structural Stress

Question it answers:

“What types of stress are dominating the risk landscape?”

Themes include:

Geopolitical conflict

Energy supply disruption

Trade / logistics stress

Policy & sanctions

Theme Pressure captures breadth, not just intensity.

Many medium events → pressure builds

Repeated narratives → structural risk

Shows what kind of crisis this is

Conceptually:
This is the story the world keeps telling you — louder and louder.

3️⃣ Asset Transmission — Market Reality Check

Question it answers:

“Is this risk actually propagating into markets?”

This connects risk to:

Gas

Oil

Freight

FX

When multiple asset classes react together, risk is no longer theoretical.

Conceptually:
This is the bridge between headlines and money.

It tells users:

“Markets are starting to feel it.”

4️⃣ Contagion (later) — Spillover Risk

Question it answers:

“Is risk spreading beyond Europe?”

Middle East

Black Sea

Global trade corridors

This is about second-order effects.

Conceptually:
This is fire jumping to the next building.

It’s powerful, but only meaningful once regional indices mature — which is why it’s v2.

Why show normalized values only

This is extremely important.

You are not showing:

Raw counts

Internal math

Proprietary scaling

You are showing:

“Relative contribution to today’s risk.”

Normalized values answer:

Which force mattered most today

What changed since yesterday

Where attention should go

Users don’t care about raw math — they care about dominance.

How visualization reinforces understanding
🟦 Stacked Bar — Composition View

Best for:

“What is today made of?”

Visually:

Each component occupies part of the bar

Larger section = bigger influence

User takeaway:

“Today’s risk is mostly regional + market transmission.”

🟠 Donut — Balance View

Best for:

“Which force dominates?”

Visually:

Clean, intuitive

Easy to compare proportions

User takeaway:

“Theme pressure is unusually high today.”

🟩 Waterfall — Build-up View

Best for:

“How did we get to 83?”

Visually:

Start from baseline

Each component pushes risk higher

Ends at today’s level

User takeaway:

“Even if markets calm, regional risk alone keeps EERI elevated.”

This is extremely powerful for analysts.

The key psychological shift for Pro users

Without this feature, users think:

“83 feels high.”

With this feature, users think:

“83 is high because regional escalation + gas + freight are all aligned.”

That difference is everything.

Why this justifies Pro pricing

This feature gives users:

Explainability

Confidence

Trust

Actionability

It answers:

Can I trust this number?

What should I watch today?

Is this noise or systemic?

Most platforms hide this.
You are monetizing insight instead.

How this should feel in the dashboard

The correct UX emotion is:

“Ah. That makes sense.”

Not:

“How is this calculated?”

“Is this arbitrary?”

“Why should I trust this?”

One final strategic note (important)

You are not just explaining EERI.

You are educating users how to think about risk.

Over time:

They will stop checking prices first

They will check EERI first

Prices become confirmation, not signal

That’s how indices become indispensable.
