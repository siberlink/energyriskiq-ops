Questions:
- Should RERI be saved daily, same as GERI?
- Can RERI data create a graphic that can be made into a product?
- What are the most important Regions for RERI?
- If I have past Alerts, should I generate RERI from them or should I star fresh?


Yes: RERI should be saved daily, exactly like GERI.

Yes: RERI time-series is perfect for graphics/products (dashboards, reports, embeds, data feeds).

Most important regions: start with 6–8 high-value “decision regions” (below).

Past alerts: generate a clearly-labeled backfill and start fresh going forward; don’t mix them without a flag.

1) Should RERI be saved daily, same as GERI?

Absolutely. Same discipline, same “time moat” logic.

Why:

Daily storage gives you credibility and auditability

It enables trend regimes (weeks/months) that buyers care about

It creates exportable datasets (feeds/APIs) later

Rule of thumb:

Compute RERI from “yesterday’s alerts” and store it permanently.

Never “rewrite history” unless you explicitly version it (e.g., reri_v1, reri_v2).

2) Can RERI data create a graphic that can be made into a product?

Yes — RERI is made for productized visuals. The strongest ones:

A) Regional Risk Curve (time-series)

30 / 90 / 365 day line chart

band shading (LOW→CRITICAL)
This becomes a core Pro feature.

B) “Risk Map” (Region tiles heatmap)

A grid of regions, each tile shows:

value, band, trend arrow
This becomes a killer homepage widget (public delayed) + dashboard (paid live).

C) Escalation Velocity Sparkline

Small sparkline + “FAST / SLOW” tag
Extremely “terminal-like” and sticky.

D) “Days in Critical” Meter

A simple bar:

“Days in CRITICAL (last 30d): 7”
This sells to procurement/risk committees.

E) Weekly / Monthly Regional Brief (PDF)

Auto-generated report:

last 7/30 day curve

biggest drivers

top affected assets
This can be a standalone product: “Europe Energy Risk Weekly”.

So yes: RERI → graphics → monetizable products very naturally.

3) What are the most important Regions for RERI?

Pick regions that map to real exposure buckets (energy flows, chokepoints, sanctions zones, shipping lanes). Start with 6–8.

Tier 1 (start here)

Middle East / Persian Gulf (oil + LNG + conflict escalation)

Europe (gas + power + sanctions + winter sensitivity)

Black Sea (grain + shipping + Russia/Ukraine spillover)

Red Sea / Suez (shipping disruption is directly monetizable)

East Asia (China demand + coal/LNG + macro energy shifts)

South China Sea / Taiwan Strait (tail risk that insurers & supply chains price)

Tier 2 (add next)

North Africa / Med (pipeline/LNG + migration + regional instability)

Caucasus / Caspian (corridors, pipelines, geopolitics)

West Africa / Gulf of Guinea (oil + piracy/shipping)

Latin America (supply shocks, politics; lower immediate pricing power)

Practical note: don’t start with 20 regions.
Start with the regions where buyers instantly say: “Yes, I need that.”

4) If I have past Alerts, should I generate RERI from them or start fresh?

Do both, but label it correctly.

✅ Best practice

A) Backfill from past alerts (so you don’t waste time already accumulated)
B) Start fresh daily from now on (your “true” operational index stream)

The key is labeling

Backfilled data is valuable, but it may differ from your live process because:

your alert model may have improved over time

sources changed

classification logic evolved

So do this:

Backfill output: reri_v1_backfill

Live output: reri_v1

In your synthetic alert raw_input, store:

backfilled: true/false

computed_at

model_version

Should you publish backfill publicly?

You can, but I’d recommend:

keep backfill internal at first

use it to validate charts/UX

later expose paid history (not public)

If your past alerts are messy

If older alerts lack consistent fields (assets/confidence), you can still backfill with fallbacks:

default confidence

treat missing assets as zero overlap

still compute S + H reliably

Recommended move (what I’d do in your situation)

Start saving RERI daily immediately (yesterday → today onward).

Backfill last 30–90 days first (fast validation + immediate charts).

If stable, backfill further (6–12 months), but keep it labeled.

That gives you:

immediate product visuals

a growing moat

clean operational dataset
