Below is a complete, best-practice blueprint for an EnergyRiskIQ “Interpretation Intelligence Layer” bot (NOT a generic chatbot). It’s designed to maximize user value, retention, and plan upgrades while keeping hallucinations + liability low.

1) Bot Feature Tiering Per User Plan (Best Conversion + Low Risk)
Core concept

Your bot has 3 modes:

Explain (safe, educational, low liability)

Interpret (contextual + index-driven reasoning)

Decide-support (scenario + portfolio/asset implications, highest value)

You gate mode depth, daily question limits, and data granularity.

Free

Goal: onboarding + curiosity → upgrade

Questions/day: 3

Modes: Explain only

Access:

“What is GERI/EERI/EGSI?”

“What does 70 mean historically?”

“How is this index constructed?” (high-level)

Output limits:

No forward scenarios

No asset mapping

No “what to do”

Upgrade hooks:

“To explain today’s drivers + alert contributors, upgrade.”

Personal ($9)

Goal: daily habit formation

Questions/day: 15

Modes: Explain + Interpret (basic)

Access:

“Why did EGSI change today?” (drivers summary)

“Top contributors (pillars)”

“Compare today vs 7-day average”

Data shown:

Pillar deltas

Top 3 alert contributors (headline-level)

Output:

“Plain English daily narrative” (short)

Upgrade hooks:

“Trader plan unlocks cross-index + asset divergence.”

Trader ($29)

Goal: trading relevance + retention

Questions/day: 60

Modes: Explain + Interpret + Decide-support (light)

Access:

Cross-index interpretation (GERI vs EERI vs EGSI)

Divergence detection explanations (GERI rising, Brent flat)

Asset-impact translation (directional sensitivity, not advice)

Data shown:

Correlation/beta summaries (rolling)

Divergence residual highlights

Regime classification label (if you have it)

Output:

“Market-facing narrative”

“Scenarios: base/upside/downside” (probabilistic, cautious)

Upgrade hooks:

“Pro unlocks full driver attribution + backtest references + alerts explanation depth.”

Pro ($49)

Goal: your flagship “Live Index Intelligence” experience

Questions/day: 200

Modes: full suite (Explain/Interpret/Decide-support)

Access:

Full driver attribution (pillars + top alerts + entity/chokepoints)

“What changed since yesterday?” with change log

“What events most likely caused this?”

“Explain signal quality” (noise vs regime shift)

Data shown:

Full contributor list (top N)

Probability engine output explanation (calibration-aware)

Model confidence + missing data flags

Output:

“Trader-grade briefing”

“Risk to assets map” (impact score bands)

“Watchlist suggestions” (NOT trades)

Upgrade hooks:

“Enterprise unlocks custom portfolio mapping, team workspaces, compliance exports.”

Enterprise ($129)

Goal: keep teams + justify cost

Questions/day: Unlimited (fair use)

Modes: full + Organization features

Access:

Portfolio exposure mapping (user-defined)

Custom entities/chokepoints list

Team shared threads + saved briefs

Compliance export mode (audit logs)

Output:

“Executive brief”

“Ops risk brief” (supply chain / shipping focus)

“Compliance-safe narrative”

2) Exact UI Placement Strategy (Where it prints money)
Rule: the bot must be contextual (pre-loaded with what user is viewing)
A) Global floating button (all pages)

Bottom-right: “Ask ERIQ Analyst”

Shows: “Ask about what you’re viewing” as default.

B) Index Dashboard pages (GERI/EERI/EGSI)

Place two bot entry points:

Inline “Explain Today” card (high CTR)

Next to the index score

Button: “Explain today’s move”

Returns a short narrative with:

Drivers

What changed

Confidence/missing data flags

Chart contextual button (feature expansion)

On hover near chart legend:

“Explain this divergence”

“Compare to last month”

“What caused this spike?”

C) Alerts pages

Button: “How did these alerts affect today’s index?”

This helps users understand why alerts matter.

D) Daily Digest page

Top: “Ask about today’s digest”

Also: “Generate a trader brief” (Trader+)

E) Upgrade moments placement (high conversion)

When user clicks a locked answer (e.g., “Show top contributors”)

When user asks a Trader/Pro-only question

When user requests “scenario” / “asset impact” / “divergence explanation”

3) Technical Architecture (RAG + Context Pipeline) — Robust + Safe
High-level components

Context Assembler (deterministic)

RAG Retriever (methodology + glossary + docs)

Answer Generator (LLM)

Verifier (post-check + citations)

Policy Guardrails (pre + post)

Telemetry + Monetization Triggers

Data sources the bot can use

A) “Live Context” (highest priority)

Today’s index values (GERI/EERI/EGSI)

Pillar contributions/deltas

Recent alerts + categories + regions

Regime label (if available)

Asset snapshots (Brent, TTF, VIX, EUR/USD, storage)

Divergence metrics (residuals, z-scores)

B) “Knowledge Base” (RAG)

Index methodology pages

FAQ/Glossary

“How to interpret EGSI”

“What does probability mean”

Internal policy: disclaimers, allowed outputs

C) User plan + permissions

Max detail level

Which datasets they can see

Limits per day

Retrieval strategy (important)

Use two-stage retrieval:

Intent routing: “methodology” vs “today interpretation” vs “asset impact”

Targeted retrieval:

Methodology → docs

“why changed today” → live context (NO need for heavy RAG)

“what is EGSI” → glossary + methodology

“compare last month” → time-series slice + brief summary

Output format rules

Always include:

Data used: “Based on EGSI pillars + last 24h alerts + TTF snapshot”

Confidence flags: missing feeds, incomplete asset series, etc.

Disclaimers: informational, not financial advice

4) Prompt Engineering Framework (Templates that feel “Bloomberg-like”)
System prompt (core identity)

“You are ERIQ Analyst, a geo-energy risk interpretation assistant.”

“You must use provided context; if missing, say what’s missing.”

“Never give investment advice or trades.”

“Cite internal sources by doc title/section (not URLs).”

Intent router prompt

Classify into:

Define/Explain (glossary)

Interpret index move (drivers)

Cross-index analysis

Asset impact translation

Scenario explanation

Troubleshooting (data gaps)

Response templates (the best ones)
Template: “Explain Today’s Move”

One-line summary (plain English)

Top drivers (pillars + alerts)

What changed since yesterday

Asset reaction snapshot (if allowed)

Confidence & caveats

What to watch next (safe)

Template: “Divergence”

What diverged (signal vs asset)

Typical reasons (3 buckets)

Which bucket fits today (using evidence)

What would confirm/deny tomorrow

Template: “Cross-index”

How indices differ

What the current combo implies

Which region/pillar is leading

Second-order effects (safe)

5) Guardrails + Hallucination Mitigation (Non-negotiable)
Pre-answer constraints

If a question asks for:

“Should I buy/sell?”

“Trade recommendations”

“Price targets”
→ refuse + redirect to “risk interpretation only”

Evidence requirement

The bot must not say “because X happened” unless:

X is present in alert set, or

X is present in knowledge base, or

X is explicitly in the provided context

“I don’t know” policy

If data missing:

Say what’s missing

Offer alternative view:

“I can still explain the methodology”

“I can summarize drivers from alerts only”

Post-answer verifier

Check for:

Uncited claims

Advice language

Overconfident forecasts

Forbidden outputs (buy/sell)

If triggered:

regenerate with safer framing

Enterprise audit log

Store:

user prompt

context snapshot hash

retrieved docs list

final answer
This becomes a selling point.

6) Monetization Trigger Logic (Best psychological conversion)
Trigger types

Hard lock (feature not available)

Soft lock (teaser + partial answer)

Rate limit (you used 3/3 today)

Depth lock (you can answer but not with full details)

Best conversion pattern: “Answer → Then lock the next layer”

Example (Free user asks: “Why EGSI jumped today?”)

Give:

Basic explanation (pillars)
Then:

“Top contributor alerts are a Pro feature.”

Upgrade prompt copy (high-performing style)

Use:

“Unlock today’s driver attribution”

“See which alerts moved EGSI”

“Get cross-index + asset divergence explanations”

“Turn raw alerts into a 60-second brief”

Upgrade UI
