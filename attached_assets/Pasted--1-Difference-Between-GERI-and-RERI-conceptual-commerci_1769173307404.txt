🔥 1. Difference Between GERI and RERI (conceptual & commercial)

Think of them as two layers of the same intelligence stack.

🟦 GERI — Global Geo-Energy Risk Index

What it answers:

“How risky is the global geopolitical & energy environment today?”

Scope:

Entire world

One single number per day

Nature:

Macro / regime-level

Strategic

Slow-moving but powerful

What it measures:

global escalation pressure

systemic instability

cross-regional contagion

Who uses it:

macro traders

CIOs / risk committees

asset allocators

strategists

media / research

Typical decisions driven by GERI:

reduce global exposure

increase volatility hedges

rotate into energy / defense

de-risk portfolios

Mental model:
GERI = “Global Risk Temperature”

Like VIX, but for geopolitics & energy.

🟥 RERI — Regional Escalation Risk Index

What it answers:

“How dangerous is THIS REGION specifically for markets & supply chains right now?”

Scope:

One index per region

Multiple numbers per day

Nature:

Tactical

Actionable

Fast-moving

What it measures:

regional escalation pressure

probability of disruption

spillover risk into assets

Who uses it:

energy traders

LNG desks

shipping planners

insurers

procurement teams

hedging desks

Typical decisions driven by RERI:

hedge Middle East exposure

reroute shipping

secure alternative suppliers

adjust gas / oil books

price insurance

Mental model:
RERI = “Regional Early-Warning Radar”

🧠 The Key Strategic Difference

This is extremely important:

GERI = Narrative & Brand Index

builds authority

builds SEO

builds citations

builds “EnergyRiskIQ Index” brand

RERI = Commercial Engine

sells feeds

sells dashboards

sells APIs

sells enterprise contracts

In real institutions:

GERI is what the board sees

RERI is what desks pay for

🔗 How They Work Together

They should always be presented as:

GLOBAL LAYER (GERI)
        ↓
REGIONAL LAYERS (RERI per region)
        ↓
ASSET LAYERS (future indices)


Meaning:

GERI explains why risk is rising globally

RERI explains where it is dangerous

Asset indices explain what is impacted

This layered architecture is exactly how institutional intelligence systems are built.
