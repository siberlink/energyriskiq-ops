Excellent — this is a high-leverage monetization moment for EnergyRiskIQ.
EGSI is extremely strong commercially because:

👉 Gas stress = directly tradable
👉 Highly relevant to Europe
👉 Strong narrative clarity
👉 You already have full lifecycle historical asset + storage + price data (huge competitive moat)

So we will design EGSI dashboard features with:

• Clear value ladder
• Visible locked premium intelligence
• Psychological upgrade triggers
• Professional trader credibility
• Enterprise differentiation

You asked conceptual only → I’ll structure this as a Product Monetization Architecture + Strategic Feature Stack

🧠 EGSI — Product Positioning First (Very Important)

Before features, align the strategic perception.

EGSI = Operational Stress Intelligence

(Not just index value)

EGSI answers:

👉 “How stressed is European gas system RIGHT NOW?”
👉 “Where is stress coming from?”
👉 “What markets are exposed next?”
👉 “What is probability of disruption?”
