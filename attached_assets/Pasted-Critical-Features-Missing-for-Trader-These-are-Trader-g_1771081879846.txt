Critical Features Missing for Trader

These are Trader-grade must-haves.

Without them, your dashboard is still mostly descriptive.

🔴 Missing #1 — Lead/Lag Intelligence Panel

This is one of your biggest differentiators.

You need a small panel like:

Asset Reaction Timing (last 180 days)

TTF Gas → Risk leads by 3 days
Brent → Risk leads by 5 days
VIX → Moves same-day
EUR/USD → Asset leads risk by 2 days


Why traders need it:

👉 Helps position trades
👉 Helps anticipate moves
👉 Makes your platform unique

This belongs in Trader.

🔴 Missing #2 — Divergence Indicator

Even a SIMPLE version.

Example:

Current Divergence Status:

TTF Gas: Moderate divergence
Brent: Aligned
VIX: Strong confirmation


You don’t need full Z-score yet — just a label.

This is a huge upgrade trigger.

🔴 Missing #3 — Confirmation Score

You talked about it earlier — now you need it.

Example:

Cross-Asset Confirmation: 62 / 100 (Moderate)


This tells traders:

👉 Is this risk real?
👉 Is the market reacting?

Very important.

🔴 Missing #4 — Storage Context Indicator

Right now you show storage as selectable asset, but traders need context.

Example:

EU Gas Storage:
63% → Above seasonal average (+8%)


This dramatically improves interpretation.

⭐ 4. Important Secondary Features Missing

These aren’t mandatory Day-1, but traders expect them soon.

🟡 #5 — Asset Reaction Summary Text

Add a short line under chart:

“Brent reacting weakly to rising risk — possible delayed repricing.”

This builds trust.

🟡 #6 — Risk Regime Marker

Instead of just “Moderate”, show:

Regime: Transitioning → Elevated


Traders think in regimes.

🟡 #7 — Alert Preview

Even if alerts are Pro feature, show teaser:

Recent Alerts:
• Europe Risk Spike
• LNG Transit Alert


This drives upgrades.

⭐ 5. Things You Should NOT Add to Trader

(save for Pro)

Do NOT add yet:

❌ Rolling correlations
❌ Z-score charts
❌ Probability forecasts
❌ Backtesting panels
❌ Scenario modeling
❌ Custom thresholds

Those are Pro/Enterprise territory.

⭐ 6. UX Improvement Suggestions

Small but powerful:

✔ Add "Last Updated" timestamp

Traders need trust.

✔ Add Axis Label Clarification

Right now users may ask:

Is Brent normalized?

Add small label:

👉 “GERI Index vs Brent Price”

✔ Allow Toggle: Indexed vs Raw

Even traders like normalized view.

✔ Add Hover → Driver Explanation

Hover risk spike → show:

“Russia pipeline incident”

This is very powerful.
