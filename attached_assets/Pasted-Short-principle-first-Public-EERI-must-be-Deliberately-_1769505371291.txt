Short principle first:

Public EERI must be:

Deliberately incomplete

Highly indexable

Explainable

Non-replicable

Brand-anchoring

You are not giving data away — you are giving signals + authority.

🔑 The Golden Rule for Public EERI

Public EERI should show:

Today’s level (delayed)

Trend

Band

Interpretation

2–3 drivers

Methodology hints

But never:

Full components

Weights

Raw scores

Normalized values

Historical depth

Asset transmission numbers

🧠 1. Core Public Block (SEO Anchor)

This should be the main on-page SEO block.

🔥 Example (exact structure I recommend)

European Energy Risk Index (EERI)
Today’s Level: 83 — CRITICAL
Trend: +12 vs 7-day average
Status: Elevated systemic disruption risk

Interpretation:
Severe geopolitical and supply-chain stress detected across European energy markets.
Primary risks currently originate from military escalation and logistics disruption.

This block alone gives you:

“European Energy Risk Index” keyword

“Energy risk Europe”

“European energy disruption”

“Energy supply risk”

→ This will rank.

📈 2. Risk Band Visualization (Very powerful for SEO + UX)

Public should always show bands, not numbers history.

Example:

Risk Level Bands

0–20 → Normal

21–40 → Elevated

41–60 → High

61–80 → Severe

81–100 → Critical

Current position: CRITICAL (83)

This creates:

Visual clarity

Trust

Long-tail SEO (“energy risk level Europe”)

📰 3. Top Public Drivers (limited, curated)

This is one of your strongest SEO weapons.

Public version should show max 3 drivers, headline only.

Example:

Top Risk Drivers Today

Russia-Ukraine war escalation impacting Eastern Europe

European aviation disruptions affecting logistics corridors

Global trade pressure increasing freight and fuel volatility

Rules:

No raw scores

No severity numbers

No confidence

No asset math

This gives:

Fresh content daily

News keyword embedding

Google recrawl magnet

Zero IP leakage

🧩 4. Affected Asset Classes (public, high value SEO)

This is extremely powerful and rare in the market.

Example:

Assets Most Affected Today

Natural Gas

Crude Oil

Freight & Shipping

Foreign Exchange

This targets:

“energy risk gas”

“oil volatility Europe”

“freight disruption Europe”

“FX risk geopolitical”

Very high-value keywords.

⏱️ 5. Date & Methodology Metadata (critical for trust + indexing)

Always show:

Index date

Computed date

Update frequency

Example:

Index Date: January 24, 2026
Computed At: January 25, 2026, 01:00 UTC
Update Frequency: Daily

This gives:

Freshness

Crawl signals

Credibility

Institutional look

🧠 6. Mini “What is EERI?” block (SEO foundation)

This should exist under every index page.

Example:

What is the European Energy Risk Index (EERI)?

The European Energy Risk Index (EERI) measures systemic geopolitical, supply-chain, and market disruption risks affecting European energy markets.
It aggregates high-impact events, asset transmission signals, and thematic pressures into a daily risk score designed for analysts, traders, and policy professionals.

This alone will rank for:

European Energy Risk Index

Energy risk Europe

Energy disruption index

Geopolitical energy risk

🔐 7. What must stay PRO only (very important)

Never show publicly:

RERI_EU value

Theme pressure raw

Asset transmission raw

Normalized components

Velocity

High-impact counts

Historical charts

Intraday signals

Cross-region contagion

These are your:

Competitive moat

Licensing value

Enterprise product

🏗️ 8. Recommended Public Page Structure (SEO-optimized)

This is the ideal structure for /indices/eeri:

H1

European Energy Risk Index (EERI)

Block 1 — Today’s Index

Level

Band

Trend

Interpretation

Block 2 — Risk Bands Visualization
Block 3 — Top Risk Drivers (3 headlines)
Block 4 — Assets Affected
Block 5 — Methodology Summary (short)
Block 6 — Update Metadata
Block 7 — Call to Action

Example:

🔐 Access full components, history, and market overlays with EnergyRiskIQ Pro.

🏁 Final strategic verdict

If you implement this public layer:

You get:

Daily fresh SEO content

Institutional credibility

Brand ownership of “Energy Risk Index”

Backlink magnet (journalists, analysts, blogs)

Zero IP leakage

Perfect funnel into Pro

This is exactly how:

VIX

MOVE
