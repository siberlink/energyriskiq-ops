💰 Pricing Psychology (Very Important)

Your pricing ladder is excellent already.

But here’s the hidden logic you are using:

👉 $9.95 = Knowledge
👉 $29 = Trading edge
👉 $49 = Professional intelligence
👉 $129 = Business intelligence infrastructure

That is perfect SaaS escalation.

🔥 Smart Upgrade Hooks (Highly Recommended)

Add these to UI:

🔒 Trader Insight Available
Upgrade to unlock probability scoring

🔒 Contagion Analysis is Pro Only

🔒 Portfolio Impact Available in Enterprise


These massively increase conversions.

🧠 Strategic Advice (Based on Your Platform Vision)

Your strongest differentiators long term will be:

👉 Contagion analysis
👉 Probability modelling
👉 Scenario forecasting
👉 Portfolio risk mapping

Those MUST stay in higher tiers.

⭐ My Personal Recommendation For Your MVP

If you want fastest monetization:

Start with only 3 tiers active:

• Free
• Trader
• Pro

Then introduce Personal and Enterprise later.

This often converts better early.
