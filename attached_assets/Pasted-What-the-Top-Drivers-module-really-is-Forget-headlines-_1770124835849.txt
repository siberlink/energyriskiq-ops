What the “Top Drivers” module really is

Forget headlines.

Conceptually, Top Drivers is a ranked map of forces currently shaping EERI.

It answers one core question:

“What events actually matter for risk right now — and why?”

This is decision support, not information delivery.

Why Public vs Pro must be different
Public view

2–3 headlines

High-level narrative

SEO and awareness

Zero operational value (by design)

Pro view

Full ranked list

Structured attributes

Comparative context

Actionable prioritization

This separation is essential:

You protect IP

You monetize insight

You avoid being a news site

The mental model for Pro users

A Pro user should think:

“These are the levers currently pushing risk higher — I need to focus here.”

Not:

“What’s happening?”

“What’s trending?”

But:

“What matters most?”

What each driver field represents (conceptually)
📰 Headline

This is context, not the value.

It answers:

“What is the event?”

But the headline alone is meaningless without the fields below.

🔥 Driver Class (High Impact / Spike)

This answers:

“Is this structurally important or situational?”

High Impact

Structural

Systemic

Persistent

Can anchor risk for days or weeks

Spike

Sudden

Localized

Often short-lived

Important for clustering detection

Conceptually:

Driver class separates earthquakes from aftershocks.

🧠 Theme (Geopolitical / Energy / Supply Chain)

This answers:

“What type of stress is this?”

Themes allow users to see:

If risk is political

If risk is physical supply

If risk is logistical

If risk is policy-driven

Conceptually:

Themes explain the nature of the crisis, not just its size.

Over time, users learn:

Which themes matter most for which assets

Which themes tend to escalate

Which fade quickly

⚠️ Severity

This answers:

“How damaging is this event in isolation?”

Severity is:

Intrinsic impact

Independent of other events

About potential, not confirmation

Conceptually:

Severity is “how hard this could hit if it propagates.”

✅ Confidence

This answers:

“How reliable is this signal?”

Confidence reflects:

Source credibility

Cross-source confirmation

Clarity of facts

Conceptually:

Confidence tells users whether this is noise or signal.

Professionals care deeply about this.

🎯 Assets Affected

This answers:

“Where does this risk show up?”

Gas, oil, freight, FX — this is the bridge between:

Narrative

Markets

Conceptually:

This is where risk meets exposure.

This is what turns a headline into a decision.

Why sorting matters more than charts

Sorting is not UI sugar — it’s prioritization logic.

Sort by Severity

“What could hurt the most?”

Sort by Confidence

“What can I trust the most?”

Sort by Asset Overlap

“What is most likely to propagate systemically?”

Users switch sort modes depending on mindset:

Morning scan → confidence

Crisis mode → severity

Portfolio review → asset overlap

This is how professionals think.

Are charts needed here?
Short answer:

No charts are required — and adding them by default would be a mistake.

Here’s why.

Why tables + ranking beat charts for Top Drivers

Top Drivers is about:

Comparison

Prioritization

Judgment

Charts are good for:

Trends

History

Evolution

But Top Drivers is:

“What matters now?”

Tables win here because:

Faster cognition

Better scanning

Clear hierarchy

Less distraction

This is a decision console, not an analytics view.

When charts do make sense (optional, later)

If you ever add charts here, they should be secondary and optional, such as:

Mini bar showing relative severity (no axes, no scales)

Asset icons lighting up (visual cue, not chart)

Hover-only micro-visuals

Never:

Time series

Line charts

Overlays

Those belong elsewhere.

How this module integrates with the rest of the platform

EERI number → tells how risky

Asset Stress Panel → tells where

Top Drivers → tells why

Together, they form a complete loop:

Level → Location → Cause

That’s rare — and extremely powerful.

The psychological effect on Pro users

When this module is done right, users feel:

“I don’t need to read everything — I know where to focus.”

That reduces:

Cognitive overload

Decision fatigue

Noise exposure

This is why professionals pay.

Final strategic verdict

Top Drivers (Pro):

Is not content

Is not news

Is not charts

Is not explanation

It is structured judgment.

And that is exactly what serious users want.
