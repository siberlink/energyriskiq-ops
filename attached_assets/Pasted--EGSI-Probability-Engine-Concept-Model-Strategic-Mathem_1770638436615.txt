🧠 EGSI Probability Engine Concept Model
(Strategic + Mathematical + Commercial Architecture)

NO CODE — but fully implementation-ready conceptually.

🎯 PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE ENGINE

The EGSI Probability Engine answers:

“Given current system stress conditions, what is the probability that specific gas market stress events occur within defined time horizons?”

🧩 EVENTS THE ENGINE SHOULD PREDICT

You should NOT predict “price directly”.

You predict stress outcomes that markets react to.

This is far more robust and defensible.

🎯 CORE EVENT SET
EVENT A — TTF Price Spike

Definition:
Probability that TTF gas price rises above statistical threshold.

Example:

Probability TTF moves +15% within 30 days

EVENT B — Storage Crisis Acceleration

Definition:
Probability storage draw exceeds seasonal norms.

EVENT C — Supply Disruption Escalation

Definition:
Probability pipeline / LNG flow reduction stress increases system-wide risk score.

EVENT D — Market Panic Regime

Definition:
Probability system transitions into panic volatility state.

EVENT E — Infrastructure Stress Cascade

Definition:
Probability multiple chokepoints become simultaneously stressed.

🧭 ENGINE STRUCTURE (Layered Model)
🔹 LAYER 1 — Feature Engineering Layer

Transforms raw EGSI + asset data into predictive signals.

INPUT DATA SOURCES

You already have the perfect dataset:

• EGSI historical values
• Storage levels
• TTF prices
• Brent prices
• VIX
• EUR/USD
• LNG & supply stress signals
• Chokepoint flags
• Alert classification outputs

CORE FEATURE SET
1️⃣ Stress Level Metrics

EGSI Level
EGSI Momentum
EGSI Acceleration
EGSI Volatility

2️⃣ System Pressure Components

Storage deviation vs seasonal norm
Supply shock intensity
LNG congestion intensity
Infrastructure disruption score

3️⃣ Market Behavior Features

Rolling correlations:

EGSI ↔ TTF
EGSI ↔ VIX
EGSI ↔ Brent

4️⃣ Divergence Residuals

This is VERY powerful.

Residual = Actual Asset Movement − Expected Movement based on EGSI

5️⃣ Regime Classification Features

Binary and categorical regime flags:

• Normal
• Structural Stress
• Event Shock
• Panic Mode

🔹 LAYER 2 — Conditional Probability Modelling

This layer answers:

"Historically, when system stress looked like THIS, what happened next?"

Method 1 — Bucketed Historical Conditioning

You create stress buckets.

Example:

EGSI 0–25
EGSI 25–50
EGSI 50–75
EGSI 75–100


For each bucket compute:

Event frequency over time horizons.

Example Output
When EGSI = 70–80:

TTF +10% within 30 days occurred 46% of time
Storage crisis occurred 31% of time
Panic regime occurred 22% of time


This is extremely powerful marketing and statistically stable.

Method 2 — Momentum Conditioning

Probability increases when:

High stress + rising momentum
High stress + accelerating momentum

Example:

P(Event | EGSI Level, EGSI Momentum, EGSI Acceleration)

Method 3 — Multi-Factor Conditional Tables

Include:

Storage stress
LNG congestion
Chokepoint risk

Example:

P(TTF spike | EGSI > 65 AND Storage deviation > 1.2σ AND LNG congestion high)

🔹 LAYER 3 — Logistic Probability Engine

This is your advanced model layer.

Concept

You model:

Probability(Event) =
Sigmoid(Weighted Stress Factors)

Inputs

Weighted linear combination:

Z =
w1 × EGSI Level
+ w2 × EGSI Momentum
+ w3 × Storage Stress
+ w4 × LNG Congestion
+ w5 × Divergence Residual
+ w6 × Regime Flag

Output
P(Event) = 1 / (1 + e^(-Z))


This allows smooth probability curves instead of step buckets.

🔹 LAYER 4 — Probability Calibration Layer

This is what makes the system professional-grade.

You must calibrate probabilities against real outcomes.

Calibration Techniques
Reliability Curves

Check:

When model predicts 70% probability
Did event occur ~70% of time?

Brier Score

Measures probability accuracy.

Rolling Recalibration

Update weights periodically.

🔹 LAYER 5 — Confidence Scoring

Probability alone is dangerous.

You must add signal reliability.

Confidence depends on:

• Data completeness
• Regime clarity
• Model agreement
• Historical sample size

Example UI:

TTF Spike Probability: 58%
Signal Confidence: HIGH

🔹 LAYER 6 — Forward Stress Radar

This becomes your visual flagship.

It shows probability curves over time horizons.

7 Day Risk Curve
30 Day Risk Curve
60 Day Risk Curve


Displayed as expanding risk cone.

🔹 LAYER 7 — Scenario Simulation Integration

Modify inputs and recompute probability.

Example:

User toggles:

"Norway pipeline outage"

Engine recomputes event probabilities.

🧠 EVENT PROBABILITY TAXONOMY

You should categorize outputs.

SHORT TERM EVENTS

7–14 days

Price spike
Volatility surge
LNG congestion

MID TERM EVENTS

30–60 days

Storage stress
Supply deficit
Infrastructure stress

STRUCTURAL EVENTS

90–180 days

System imbalance
Seasonal crisis risk

🔬 BACKTESTING ENGINE DESIGN

Critical for credibility.

Each event prediction must be trackable.

You generate:

• Hit rate
• False positive rate
• Calibration curves
• Regime performance

These metrics become marketing assets.

🧭 DAILY COMPUTE FLOW (Conceptual)

⭐ YOUR SECRET WEAPON (Most Competitors Don't Do This)

Combine:

Divergence residuals

Regime detection

Storage seasonality modelling

This dramatically improves prediction power.

🔥 OPTIONAL ADVANCED FEATURE (Pro+ Only)
Probability Change Tracking

“Probability increased from 28% → 41% in last 3 days”

Users LOVE this.

🧠 STRATEGIC POSITIONING STATEMENT (Marketing Gold)

You can safely claim:

EGSI does not predict prices directly.
It models systemic gas stress conditions that historically precede price movements and supply disruptions.

This sounds extremely credible.
