# EERI Features According to User Plan

## PART 1 — Evaluation of Current EERI Pro Dashboard

### Strengths

**1. Clear Hierarchical Risk Presentation**

The dashboard correctly starts with:
- Real-time index card
- Component breakdown
- Asset stress panel

This matches how institutional desks think.

**2. Excellent Explainability Layer**

- Top Drivers module
- Component transparency
- Historical intelligence
- Regime statistics

These are premium-grade features. Very rare.

**3. Proper Multi-Scale Risk View**

Coverage includes:
- Instant risk state
- Structural history
- Driver analysis
- Market exposure

This is exactly how professional risk intelligence tools operate.

### Missing Piece (Strategically Important)

Currently lacking a **mid-timeframe interpretive layer**.

Available:
- Daily interpretation
- Historical analytics

Not available:
- **Weekly intelligence summary**

That gap is what the Weekly Snapshot fills.

---

## PART 2 — Where Weekly Snapshot Should Live (By Plan)

### PUBLIC EERI PAGE

*(Already implemented)*

**Placement:**
- After Risk Bands
- Before Daily Narrative

### USER DASHBOARD (All Paid Plans)

**Placement:**

```
Top Risk Drivers
      ↓
⭐ INSERT WEEKLY SNAPSHOT HERE
      ↓
Historical Intelligence
```

**Why This Placement Is Perfect:**

- Weekly Snapshot answers: *"How does this week fit into the trend?"*
- Historical Intelligence answers: *"How does the long history behave?"*

This is a natural cognitive bridge.
