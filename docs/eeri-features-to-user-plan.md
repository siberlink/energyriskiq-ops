# EERI Features According to User Plan

## PART 1 — Evaluation of Current EERI Pro Dashboard

### Strengths

**1. Clear Hierarchical Risk Presentation**

The dashboard correctly starts with:
- Real-time index card
- Component breakdown
- Asset stress panel

This matches how institutional desks think.

**2. Excellent Explainability Layer**

- Top Drivers module
- Component transparency
- Historical intelligence
- Regime statistics

These are premium-grade features. Very rare.

**3. Proper Multi-Scale Risk View**

Coverage includes:
- Instant risk state
- Structural history
- Driver analysis
- Market exposure

This is exactly how professional risk intelligence tools operate.

### Missing Piece (Strategically Important)

Currently lacking a **mid-timeframe interpretive layer**.

Available:
- Daily interpretation
- Historical analytics

Not available:
- **Weekly intelligence summary**

That gap is what the Weekly Snapshot fills.
