- EU Storage seasonal data
- AI driver classification

The following features can be safely gated as premium:
- **Full history**
- **Multi-overlay**
- **Explainability**
- **Divergence analytics**

These four are the strongest conversion drivers.

---

# Visualization & Interpretation Framework

The way you VISUALIZE + INTERPRET asset data against GERI transforms the platform from "data dashboard" into "decision intelligence platform".

**Key Advantage:**
- Full lifecycle historical data
- Multi-asset macro coverage
- Risk index (GERI) that acts as anchor signal

---

## Core Philosophy

**GERI is NOT another asset.**

GERI is the risk thermometer. Assets are the market reaction.

The chart system must visually answer:
- Is risk rising?
- Which asset reacts first?
- Which asset overreacts?
- Which asset ignores risk?
- Are we entering systemic stress?

---

## Master Chart Concept: Risk → Market Response Framework

Every chart must show 3 layers simultaneously:

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Layer 1 — Risk Signal (GERI) | The anchor |
| Layer 2 — Asset Response | The observable market reaction |
| Layer 3 — Interpretation Overlay | Automated explanation |

---

## Chart Architecture

### 1. Unified Overlay Chart (Primary Chart)

This is the flagship visualization.

**Chart Layout:**

| Axis | Content |
|------|---------|
| X-Axis | Time (full lifecycle of GERI) |
| Y-Axis LEFT | GERI (0–100 scale) — Always left, normalized, bold |
| Y-Axis RIGHT | Selected Asset Price (Brent / TTF / VIX / EURUSD / Storage) |

**Visual Styling:**

**GERI:**
- Thick line
- Color-coded by risk band:
  - Green → Normal
  - Yellow → Elevated
  - Orange → High
  - Red → Severe/Critical

**Assets:**
- Thin clean lines
- Different color per asset

### 2. Regime Highlight Bands (High Value Feature)

Background shading behind the chart:

| Risk Level | Background Color |
|------------|------------------|
| Normal | Very light green |
| Elevated | Light yellow |
| High | Light orange |
| Severe | Red gradient |

This gives instant macro interpretation without reading numbers.

### 3. Risk–Response Timing Markers (Secret Weapon)

Place markers when:

**GERI leads asset movement:**
> "Risk signal preceded Brent move by 5 days"

**Asset moves without risk confirmation:**
> "Market volatility spike without systemic risk confirmation"

This turns the chart into predictive intelligence, not just historical overlay.

### 4. Normalization Toggle (Critical Feature)

Users must be able to toggle:

**Raw Price Mode:**
- Shows actual price values

**Indexed Mode (Recommended Default):**
- Start all lines at 100 on selected date
- Allows pure response comparison
- Removes price scale distortion

Institutional users value this highly.

### 5. Rolling Correlation Panel

Optional secondary mini-chart below main chart.

Shows:
- Correlation between GERI and selected asset
- Positive correlation spike
- Correlation breakdown
- Regime shift signal

---

## Asset-Specific Interpretation Framework

This is where the platform becomes unique.

### Brent Oil — Interpretation Logic

**What Brent Represents:** Global energy supply expectations

| Scenario | Pattern | Interpretation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| A | GERI ↑ Brent ↑ | Supply disruption fear confirmed. Very strong systemic signal. |
| B | GERI ↑ Brent flat/down | Markets expect disruption to be temporary or politically contained. Watch for delayed oil repricing. |
| C | Brent ↑ GERI stable | Demand-driven rally or production constraints unrelated to geopolitical escalation. |

### TTF Gas — Interpretation Logic

**What TTF Represents:** European vulnerability indicator. Most sensitive asset to geopolitical gas risk.

| Scenario | Pattern | Interpretation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| A | GERI ↑ TTF ↑ sharply | Europe gas stress confirmed. Often early indicator of winter energy crisis. |
| B | GERI ↑ TTF stable | Storage buffers absorbing risk. Europe currently protected. |
| C | TTF ↑ GERI stable | Localized infrastructure or weather-driven stress. |

### VIX — Interpretation Logic

**What VIX Represents:** Global financial stress sentiment

| Scenario | Pattern | Interpretation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| A | GERI ↑ VIX ↑ | Energy risk spilling into global financial markets. Macro systemic stress signal. |
| B | GERI ↑ VIX flat | Risk still sector-contained. Opportunity environment. |

### EUR/USD — Interpretation Logic

**What EUR/USD Represents:** Europe macro vulnerability

| Scenario | Pattern | Interpretation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| A | GERI ↑ EUR ↓ | Capital flight from Europe. Energy dependency risk priced in. |
| B | GERI ↑ EUR stable | ECB / macro offsets buffering energy shock. |

### EU Gas Storage — Interpretation Logic

**What Storage Represents:** This is the most underrated dataset. Storage answers: "Is Europe prepared?"

| Scenario | Pattern | Interpretation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| A | High GERI + Low Storage | Maximum vulnerability state. Historically highest TTF volatility probability. |
| B | High GERI + High Storage | Risk muted by buffer. Markets often overreact early. |

---

## Lifecycle Interpretation Layer (High-End Feature)

Divide the entire GERI history into phases:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Risk Accumulation | GERI rising gradually, assets react slowly |
| Shock | GERI spike, assets overshoot |
| Stabilization | GERI falls, assets remain volatile |
| Recovery | GERI low, assets normalize |

Automatically label these phases on chart timeline.

---

## Automated Interpretation Panel (Game Changer)

Display next to the chart:

### 1. Current Market State

Example:
> "Energy risk is HIGH and accelerating. TTF Gas is reacting strongly. Brent is lagging risk signal. European storage remains above seasonal average, partially offsetting risk."

### 2. Risk Outlook Classification

- Risk Leading Markets
- Markets Leading Risk
- Systemic Convergence
- Temporary Divergence

---

## Multi-Asset Intelligence Mode (Pro/Enterprise)

Allow overlay of:
- GERI + Brent + TTF + VIX + EUR + Storage

Then auto-generate:
- Systemic stress score
- Cross-asset confirmation rating

---

## Time Control Concept

Offer:
- 7D
- 30D
- 90D
- 1Y
- Since Launch

**AND Comparison Mode:**
- Compare two periods visually

---

## Most Important Insight to Show Users

**Not enough dashboards do this:**

Show:
> "Risk usually leads TTF by X days historically"

> "Risk leads Brent by X days during high volatility regimes"

This builds:
- Trust
- Predictive perception
- Subscription stickiness

---

## UX Rule

**Never show asset data alone.**

**Always show asset data in risk context.**

This is the entire brand identity.

---

## Competitive Differentiation

Most dashboards show:
> Price → Explanation

EnergyRiskIQ shows:
> **Risk → Market Reaction → Forward Risk**

That is extremely rare.

### B. Main Chart Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Overlay** (default) | GERI line + selected assets. Risk band shading ON by default. |
| **Divergence** | Shows GERI vs expected asset move and flags "decoupling zones" |
| **Correlation** | Main chart stays, but lower panel shows rolling correlation |
| **Storage Context** (specialized) | EU Storage shown as percent + seasonal percentile, plus GERI |

### C. Tooltip Spec (Must-Have)

On hover display:
- Date
- GERI value + band
- Each asset value (raw) + normalized value
- Derived metrics:
  - ΔGERI (1D / 7D)
  - ΔAsset (1D / 7D)
  - Best lag (per asset)
  - Divergence score (per asset)
  - Confirmation score (overall)

---

## 2. Statistical Logic Model (Lag + Divergence Automatically)

**Design goal:** Robust, explainable daily metrics. Use changes/returns (not raw levels).

### A. Preprocessing

For each asset series P_t:

**Price-like assets (Brent, TTF, VIX, EUR/USD):** Log returns
```
r_t = ln(P_t) - ln(P_{t-1})
```

**EU Gas Storage (level-like, bounded):** Simple delta
```
r_t = S_t - S_{t-1}
```

**GERI (0–100):** Simple delta
```
g_t = G_t - G_{t-1}
```

**Optional smoothing (user selectable):**
- 3-day moving average (MA) on g_t and r_t
- 7-day moving average (MA) on g_t and r_t

### B. Lag Detection (Per Asset)

**Goal:** Find lag L where GERI changes best align with asset response.

```
Choose lag window:
  L in [-14, +14] days
  (negative = asset leads risk; positive = risk leads asset)

Compute correlation on changes:
  rho(L) = corr(g_t, r_{t+L})

Pick best lag:
  L* = argmax_L |rho(L)|

Store:
  L* and rho* = rho(L*)
```

**Stability check (avoid noisy results):**
- Require |rho*| >= rho_min (typical range: 0.15–0.25, tuned to data)
- Require enough samples in-window (e.g., >= 120 daily observations)

### C. Expected-Response Model (Simple, Explainable)

Fit a linear mapping from risk change to asset change on a rolling window W (example: 180 days), using best lag L*.

```
Model:
  r_{t+L*} ≈ alpha + beta * g_t

Estimate alpha, beta via robust regression (Huber) or OLS.
```

### D. Divergence Score (Per Asset, Per Day)

```
Predicted return:
  rhat_{t+L*} = alpha + beta * g_t

Residual:
  e_{t+L*} = r_{t+L*} - rhat_{t+L*}

Normalize by rolling residual volatility:
  sigma_e = std(e over last W)

Divergence Z-score:
  D_t = e_t / sigma_e
```

**Interpretation thresholds:**
| Divergence Score | Interpretation |
|------------------|----------------|
| \|D_t\| < 1 | Normal alignment |
| 1 <= \|D_t\| < 2 | Mild divergence |
| \|D_t\| >= 2 | Strong divergence (flag zone) |

### E. Confirmation Score (System-Level)

```
Per asset alignment:
  alignment = 1 - min(|D_t| / 3, 1)   (clamps at 0 when |D_t| >= 3)
  C_asset = 100 * alignment

Suggested weights (tune later):
  w_TTF = 0.30
  w_Brent = 0.25
  w_VIX = 0.20
  w_EURUSD = 0.15
  w_Storage = 0.10

Overall confirmation:
  C_total = sum_i (w_i * C_i)
```

### F. Regime Shift Detection (Simple)

Mark a regime change if:
- Risk band changed (based on G_t)
- |g_t| exceeds a threshold (example: >= 8 points/day)

Render these as vertical markers on the main chart.

---

## 3. User Interpretation Engine (Analyst Commentary Templates)

Use deterministic templates driven by computed inputs: band, trend, momentum, confirmation score, and per-asset lag/divergence/direction.

### A. "Current State" Template (Always Shown)

```
Template:
  Risk Level: {band} ({G_t}/100)
  Trend: {trend_label} ({Delta7D} over 7D)
  Market Confirmation: {C_total}/100 ({confirm_label})

Rules for confirm_label:
  C_total >= 70  -> "Strong cross-asset confirmation"
  45 <= C_total <= 69 -> "Mixed confirmation"
  C_total < 45   -> "Weak confirmation / possible decoupling"
```

### B. "Lead/Lag" Template (Per Asset)

```
Template:
  {Asset}: historically responds {lead_lag_text} by {L*} days in the current regime (corr {rho*}).

lead_lag_text:
  L* > 0 -> "after risk moves"
  L* = 0 -> "same-day with risk"
  L* < 0 -> "before risk moves"
```

### C. "Divergence" Template (Per Asset, Conditional)

**Trigger:** |D_t| >= 2

```
Template:
  {Asset} divergence: risk implies a move of ~{pred_move}, but market printed {actual_move}.
  Interpretation: {divergence_read}

Example divergence_read rules:
  If GERI rising but asset not reacting (beta > 0, predicted up, actual flat/down):
    "Market is discounting the risk signal or pricing a short-lived shock."
  If asset spikes while GERI stable:
    "Likely idiosyncratic driver (weather/infrastructure/liquidity) rather than systemic risk."
```

### D. "Systemic vs Contained" Template (Big Insight)

**Use cues:**
- High GERI + VIX aligned → systemic
- High GERI + VIX misaligned → contained
- High GERI + TTF aligned + low storage percentile → Europe stress
- High GERI + high storage percentile + muted TTF → buffered risk

```
Template:
  System classification: {system_label}.
  Why: {reason_1}; {reason_2}.
  Watch next: {watch_item}.

system_label rules:
  "Systemic stress": C_total >= 70 AND VIX aligned (|D| < 1.5)
  "Sector-contained risk": GERI high but VIX misaligned
  "Europe gas stress": TTF aligned + storage percentile low
  "Buffered risk": storage percentile high + TTF muted
```

### E. "What Changed Since Yesterday" (Delta Narrative)

**Inputs:** DeltaGERI_1D, DeltaAsset_1D, band change, divergence change

```
Template:
  Since yesterday: GERI {up/down} {DeltaGERI}.
  Main market reaction: {top_asset} moved {DeltaAsset}.
  Signal quality: {improved/worsened} (confirmation {DeltaC_total}).
```

### F. "Actionable Read" (Careful Wording, Not Advice)

```
Template:
  Monitoring focus (next 24-48h): {asset_or_context}.
  If risk continues {up/down}: expect {asset} to {likely_move} based on historical response (lag {L*}d).
  If divergence persists: watch for {reversion_trigger}.
```

---

## 4. Data Normalization Algorithm Spec (Overlay Accuracy)

**Goal:** Enable shape comparison without misleading users.

### A. Standardize Date Alignment

- Build a unified daily calendar from min(GERI_date, asset_date) to max.
- Forward-fill rules:
  - **Prices:** Do not forward-fill across missing market days unless explicitly marking non-trading days; better to keep gaps (or show missing).
  - **Storage (weekly-ish):** Forward-fill is acceptable, but show a "stale" indicator (days since last update).

### B. Normalization Modes (User Toggle)

**1) Raw (no normalization)**
- GERI on left axis (0–100)
- Assets on right axis in native units
- Use when the user wants actual levels

**2) Indexed to 100 (Recommended Default for Multi-Asset Overlays)**

```
Choose base date t0 = first visible date in selected range.

Price-like assets:
  I_t = 100 * (P_t / P_{t0})

Storage options:
  Option A (indexed): I_t = 100 * (S_t / S_{t0})
  Option B (percent-of-capacity): keep S_t (%) and use dual-axis + seasonal percentile line

GERI:
  Recommended: keep GERI on 0–100 for interpretability.
  Optional: I^G_t = 100 * (G_t / G_{t0})
```

**3) Z-score (Best for "Is This Move Unusual?")**

```
Compute within visible window (or rolling window W):
  Z_t = (x_t - mu) / sigma

Use for:
  - Divergence mode
  - Cross-asset "shock" comparisons
```

### C. Smoothing (Visual + Analytical)

**Offer:**
- Raw
- 3-day MA
- 7-day MA

**Spec:**
- Apply MA after normalization in Indexed/Z modes (cleaner visuals)
- For divergence computations, apply smoothing consistently to both g_t and r_t

### D. EU Storage Seasonal Context (Special Spec)

Storage is seasonal; the most truthful overlay is:
- **Primary:** Storage level (%) line
- **Secondary:** Seasonal percentile or "vs seasonal average" line (percentile by week-of-year)

If history is limited: use "vs recent baseline" (last 2–3 years if available) or show only max/min since launch.

### E. Handling Outliers (Avoid Chart Distortion)

- **Winsorize returns for divergence computations:** Clamp r_t at rolling 1st/99th percentiles
- **Do not clamp raw price charts:** Users may want to see spikes

### F. Consistency Rules (Prevents User Confusion)

- Same selected window applies to:
  - Main chart
  - Rolling correlation panel
  - Divergence panel
- Tooltip always shows both raw and normalized values (when normalization is enabled)
