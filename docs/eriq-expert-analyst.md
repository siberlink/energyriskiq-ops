# ERIQ — The Expert Analyst

## EnergyRiskIQ Interpretation Intelligence Layer

---

## Strategic Vision

ERIQ is an **Interpretation Intelligence Layer** — not a generic chatbot. This distinction is critical to the entire design philosophy.

In risk-intelligence SaaS, interpretation is usually more valuable than raw data. EnergyRiskIQ already possesses GERI, EERI, EGSI, asset correlation models, alert engines, probability scoring, and a daily digest system. ERIQ transforms this data foundation into interactive, contextual intelligence.

**Strategic Rating: 9.5 / 10 Feature Opportunity**

ERIQ strengthens:
- Product depth
- Authority perception
- Monetization ladder
- Competitive moat
- Retention
- User education

---

## The Problem ERIQ Solves

Most users (even professionals) struggle with:

- Translating indices into market actions
- Understanding cross-index relationships
- Understanding probability vs noise
- Synthesizing alerts + assets + regimes

ERIQ's positioning:

**"Your Geo-Energy Risk Analyst Assistant"**

This is extremely powerful positioning in the energy intelligence market.

---

## What ERIQ Does

### 1. Index Interpreter

Example user question: *"Why did EGSI jump today?"*

ERIQ answers using:
- Alerts driving the score
- Pillar contributions
- Historical context
- Asset reactions
- Probability shifts

### 2. Cross-Index Explainer

Example: *"GERI rising but EERI stable — what does it mean?"*

This is extremely valuable insight territory. Cross-index divergences and convergences are among the most powerful analytical signals the platform produces, and most users cannot interpret them without assistance.

### 3. Asset Impact Translator

Example: *"What does current GERI imply for Brent or TTF?"*

This connects the platform directly to trading relevance, translating abstract risk scores into asset-level implications that energy market professionals can act on.

### 4. Daily Digest Narrator

Users value narrative explanation of data. ERIQ can:
- Expand the daily digest with deeper context
- Explain risk drivers in plain language
- Provide scenario paths and forward-looking analysis
- Highlight hidden signals that the standard digest may not emphasise

### 5. Education and Onboarding Assistant

A massive churn reducer. Example: *"What does an EGSI score of 72 mean?"*

New subscribers who understand the platform's intelligence products are dramatically more likely to remain subscribed.

---

## Monetization Structure

ERIQ is tiered across subscription plans, functioning as a premium conversion driver.

### Free Plan
- Limited questions per day
- Basic explanations
- Educational content only

### Personal Plan
- Full daily digest explanation
- Index interpretation
- Limited scenario analysis

### Trader Plan
- Cross-index interaction
- Asset impact modeling
- Divergence explanation

### Pro / Enterprise
- Custom scenario simulation
- Portfolio impact interpretation
- Alert impact forward modeling
- Ask-the-Analyst style conversations

---

## Competitive Differentiation

Most competitors offer:
- Charts
- Raw data
- Static reports

Almost nobody offers **interactive intelligence**.

ERIQ moves EnergyRiskIQ toward a Bloomberg-style analyst layer — but AI-scalable. This is very strong positioning in a market where interpretation is the scarce commodity, not data.

---

## Design Principles

### What ERIQ Must Be

- Context-grounded assistant
- Data-connected assistant
- Index-aware assistant
- Alert-aware assistant

### What ERIQ Must NOT Be

- Generic ChatGPT clone
- Open domain assistant
- Free-form hallucination bot

---

## Architecture

### Layer 1 — Context Engine

Feeds ERIQ with:
- Current index values (GERI, EERI, EGSI-M, EGSI-S)
- Pillar and component contributions
- Alert summaries (recent and historical)
- Asset correlation snapshots
- Regime classification (Calm, Moderate, Elevated Uncertainty, Risk Build, Gas-Storage Stress, Shock)
- Probability engine output

### Layer 2 — Knowledge Guardrails

Restricts ERIQ to:
- EnergyRiskIQ methodology (GERI, EERI, EGSI documentation)
- Verified internal data only
- Historical index data
- Approved macro-energy knowledge
- No financial advice, no fabricated data, no hallucinated events

### Layer 3 — Interpretation Models

Structured prompt templates for:
- "Explain index move"
- "Translate risk into asset implication"
- "Compare indices"
- "Generate daily narrative"
- "Assess regime transition probability"
- "Explain divergence between signals"

### Layer 4 — UX Integration

ERIQ appears inside:
- Dashboard pages
- Alert pages
- Digest page
- Chart pages

Context-aware entry is critical — ERIQ must know which page the user is on and what data they are viewing.

---

## Hidden Strategic Benefit

ERIQ becomes a **behavioral analytics engine**. Through user interactions, the platform learns:

- What users don't understand
- What signals traders care about most
- What drives subscription conversions
- What features to build next

This is extremely valuable product intelligence that informs the entire roadmap.

---

## Retention Impact

Users stay subscribed when they feel they are learning something daily. An interpretation assistant dramatically increases this perception of ongoing value. The daily interaction pattern (check index, ask ERIQ, understand implications) creates a habit loop that is the strongest retention mechanism in SaaS.

---

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1 — Digest Interpreter Bot (Fastest Win)
- Safest entry point
- Highest engagement potential
- Lowest hallucination risk
- Grounded entirely in existing daily digest data

### Phase 2 — Index Explanation Bot
- GERI / EERI / EGSI interpretation
- "Why did this index move?" functionality
- Component and pillar decomposition explanations

### Phase 3 — Cross-Index Intelligence
- Trader-grade insight across multiple indices
- Divergence and convergence analysis
- Correlation and regime transition discussion

### Phase 4 — Scenario Simulator
- Enterprise killer feature
- Custom scenario modeling
- Portfolio impact interpretation
- Forward-looking probability paths

---

## Branding

The feature is branded as **ERIQ** — not "chatbot."

Positioning alternatives considered:
- ERIQ Analyst
- Risk Interpreter
- Geo-Energy Intelligence Assistant
- ERIQ Navigator
- Risk Lens AI

Branding matters massively for perception. "Chatbot" implies generic; "Analyst" implies expertise and authority.

---

## When This Would Be a Bad Idea

Only if:
- Built too early without guardrails
- Built as generic AI without index context
- Built without subscription gating
- Built without data connection to live indices and alerts

---

## Strategic Recommendation

**Yes — implement it.**

But:
- Start narrow
- Start contextual
- Start with interpretation — not conversation

---

## Implementation Blueprint

### Bot Operating Modes

ERIQ operates in three distinct modes, gated by subscription tier. This ensures safety, conversion leverage, and progressive value delivery.

**Mode 1 — Explain (Safe, Educational, Low Liability)**
Answers methodology questions, defines terms, provides historical context. No forward-looking analysis, no asset implications. This is the entry-level mode available to all users.

**Mode 2 — Interpret (Contextual, Index-Driven Reasoning)**
Explains today's moves using live index data, pillar contributions, alert drivers, and regime classification. Connects data points into narrative intelligence. Available from Personal tier upward.

**Mode 3 — Decide-Support (Scenario + Asset Implications, Highest Value)**
Provides cross-index divergence analysis, asset impact translation, probability-based outlooks, and scenario modeling. The most valuable mode, available at Trader tier and above with full depth at Pro/Enterprise.

---

## UI Placement Strategy

**Rule:** ERIQ must be contextual — pre-loaded with what the user is currently viewing.

### A) Global Floating Button (All Pages)

- Bottom-right position: "Ask ERIQ Analyst"
- Default prompt: "Ask about what you're viewing"
- Context-aware: automatically loads relevant page data

### B) Index Dashboard Pages (GERI / EERI / EGSI)

Two bot entry points:

**Inline "Explain Today" Card (High Click-Through):**
- Positioned next to the index score
- Button: "Explain today's move"
- Returns short narrative with drivers, what changed, confidence/missing data flags

**Chart Contextual Button:**
- On hover near chart legend
- Options: "Explain this divergence" / "Compare to last month" / "What caused this spike?"

### C) Alerts Pages

- Button: "How did these alerts affect today's index?"
- Helps users understand alert-to-index transmission

### D) Daily Digest Page

- Top: "Ask about today's digest"
- Additional: "Generate a trader brief" (Trader tier and above)

### E) Upgrade Moment Placement (High Conversion)

Upgrade prompts appear when:
- User clicks a locked answer (e.g., "Show top contributors")
- User asks a Trader/Pro-only question from a lower tier
- User requests "scenario" / "asset impact" / "divergence explanation" without sufficient plan access

## Technical Architecture (RAG + Context Pipeline)

### Components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Context Assembler | Deterministic data loading — gathers live index values, alerts, assets |
| RAG Retriever | Methodology + glossary + documentation retrieval |
| Answer Generator | LLM-powered response generation |
| Verifier | Post-answer check for citations, advice language, overconfidence |
| Policy Guardrails | Pre-answer and post-answer safety filters |
| Telemetry + Monetization Triggers | Usage tracking, conversion event detection |

### Data Sources

**A) Live Context (Highest Priority)**
- Today's index values (GERI, EERI, EGSI-M, EGSI-S)
- Pillar contributions and deltas
- Recent alerts + categories + regions
- Regime label
- Asset snapshots (Brent, TTF, VIX, EUR/USD, Storage)
- Divergence metrics (residuals, z-scores)

**B) Knowledge Base (RAG)**
- Index methodology pages (GERI, EERI, EGSI documentation)
- FAQ and glossary
- "How to interpret EGSI" guides
- "What does probability mean" explainers
- Internal policy: disclaimers, allowed outputs

**C) User Plan + Permissions**
- Maximum detail level for the user's tier
- Which datasets they can access
- Daily question limits remaining

### Retrieval Strategy

Two-stage retrieval to minimise latency and hallucination:

**Stage 1 — Intent Routing:**
Classify the user's question into one of:
- Methodology question
- Today's interpretation question
- Asset impact question
- Cross-index comparison
- Historical comparison
- Troubleshooting / data gap question

**Stage 2 — Targeted Retrieval:**

| Intent | Data Source | RAG Needed? |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| "What is EGSI?" | Glossary + methodology docs | Yes |
| "Why did GERI change today?" | Live context (pillars, alerts) | No |
| "Compare to last month" | Time-series slice + brief summary | Minimal |
| "What does probability mean?" | Knowledge base | Yes |
| "GERI rising but Brent flat" | Live context + asset snapshots | No |

### Output Format Rules

Every ERIQ response must include:

- **Data attribution:** "Based on EGSI pillars + last 24h alerts + TTF snapshot"
- **Confidence flags:** Missing feeds, incomplete asset series, data gaps
- **Disclaimer:** "Informational only. Not financial advice."

---

## Prompt Engineering Framework

### System Prompt (Core Identity)

> "You are ERIQ Analyst, a geo-energy risk interpretation assistant for the EnergyRiskIQ platform."
>
> "You must use provided context; if data is missing, state what is missing."
>
> "Never give investment advice or trade recommendations."
>
> "Cite internal sources by document title or section (not URLs)."

### Intent Router Prompt

Classifies user questions into:
1. Define/Explain (glossary)
2. Interpret index move (drivers)
3. Cross-index analysis
4. Asset impact translation
5. Scenario explanation
6. Troubleshooting (data gaps)

### Response Templates

**Template: "Explain Today's Move"**
1. One-line summary (plain English)
2. Top drivers (pillars + alerts)
3. What changed since yesterday
4. Asset reaction snapshot (if plan allows)
5. Confidence and caveats
6. What to watch next (safe, non-advisory)

**Template: "Divergence"**
1. What diverged (signal vs asset, or index vs index)
2. Typical reasons (3 analytical buckets)
3. Which bucket fits today (using evidence from live context)
4. What would confirm or deny the interpretation tomorrow

**Template: "Cross-Index"**
1. How the indices differ in what they measure
2. What the current combination implies
3. Which region or pillar is leading
4. Second-order effects (safe, contextual)

---

## Guardrails and Hallucination Mitigation

### Pre-Answer Constraints

If a question asks for:
- "Should I buy/sell?"
- "Trade recommendations"
- "Price targets"

ERIQ refuses and redirects: "I provide risk interpretation only. For trading decisions, consult your advisor or compliance team."

### Evidence Requirement

ERIQ must not say "because X happened" unless:
- X is present in the alert set, OR
- X is present in the knowledge base, OR
- X is explicitly in the provided live context

### "I Don't Know" Policy

If data is missing, ERIQ:
- States what is missing explicitly
- Offers an alternative view: "I can still explain the methodology" or "I can summarize drivers from available alerts only"
- Never fabricates data to fill the gap

### Post-Answer Verifier

Checks every response for:
- Uncited claims (statements not grounded in provided context)
- Advice language ("you should buy/sell/hedge")
- Overconfident forecasts (certainty language without probabilistic framing)
- Forbidden outputs (trade recommendations, price targets)

If triggered: regenerate with safer framing.

### Enterprise Audit Log

Stores for compliance:
- User prompt (full text)
- Context snapshot hash
- Retrieved documents list
- Final answer (full text)

This becomes a selling point for Enterprise customers with compliance requirements.

---

## Monetization Trigger Logic

### Trigger Types

| Trigger | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| Hard lock | Feature not available at this plan tier |
| Soft lock | Teaser + partial answer, then upgrade prompt |
| Rate limit | "You have used 3/3 questions today" |
| Depth lock | Answer provided but without full detail |

### Conversion Pattern: "Answer, Then Lock the Next Layer"

**Example (Free user asks: "Why did EGSI jump today?"):**

ERIQ gives:
- Basic explanation using pillars (Explain mode)

Then shows:
- "Top contributor alerts are available on the Pro plan."

### Upgrade Prompt Copy (High-Performing Style)

- "Unlock today's driver attribution"
- "See which alerts moved EGSI"
- "Get cross-index and asset divergence explanations"
- "Turn raw alerts into a 60-second brief"

### Upgrade UI

- 3 bullet points maximum
- 1 screenshot thumbnail (ERIQ showing a deep answer)
- Single CTA button: "Upgrade to [Plan Name]"
