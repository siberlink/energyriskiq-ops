# EERI Pro Plan Dashboard Features (Recommended)

## 1. Core Pro Charts (the backbone)

These are must-have — the backbone of the Pro experience.

### Correlation & Overlay Charts

Each chart should allow overlay + toggle + zoom.

| Chart | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **EERI vs Brent Crude** | Spot regime shifts (risk → oil response lag) |
| **EERI vs TTF Gas** | Europe-specific stress signal (very strong value) |
| **EERI vs European Gas (front-month)** | Direct gas market correlation |
| **EERI vs VIX** | Macro risk vs energy-specific divergence |
| **EERI vs Freight Index** | Supply-chain & logistics transmission |

**Pro insight:** Most platforms show price → risk. We show risk → price.

---

## 2. Advanced Time Controls (Pro-only)

Give users control, not just charts.

**Time ranges:**
- 7D / 30D / 90D / Since Launch

**Toggle:**
- Index only
- Asset only
- Overlay mode

**Smoothing:**
- Raw
- 3-day MA
- 7-day MA

This makes the dashboard feel analyst-grade, not retail.

---

## 3. Component Transparency (Pro-exclusive)

This is where Pro really earns its price.

### EERI Component Breakdown

Show normalized values only (never raw):
- RERI_EU contribution
- Theme Pressure
- Asset Transmission
- (Later) Contagion

**Visualize as:**
- Stacked bar
- Donut
- Waterfall

➡️ Users see *why* today is 83, not just *that* it is.

---

## 4. Asset Stress Panel (Highly Valuable)

A compact but powerful module.

### Asset Stress Snapshot

| Asset | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Gas | High |
| Oil | Elevated |
| Freight | Severe |
| FX | Elevated |

**Optional:**
- Directional bias (↑ ↓ ~)
- Color-coded risk bands

This is extremely attractive to traders and analysts.

---

## 5. Top Drivers — Full Version (Pro)

Public sees 2–3 headlines. Pro sees the real engine.

**For each driver:**
- Headline
- Driver class (high impact / spike)
- Theme (geopolitical, energy, supply chain)
- Severity
- Confidence
- Assets affected

**Sort by:**
- Severity
- Confidence
- Asset overlap

This is decision support, not news.

---

## 6. Historical Intelligence (Pro-only)

This is one of the strongest moats.

### Historical Views

- EERI history (daily)
- Risk band history (% of time in CRITICAL, HIGH, etc.)

**Compare:**
- This week vs last week
- This month vs last month

**Optional advanced view:**
- "Last time EERI ≥ 80, what happened next?"

---

## 7. Alerts & Thresholds (Pro)

Let users interact with the index.

**Notify when:**
- EERI crosses 60 / 70 / 80
- Sharp day-over-day change (Δ ≥ X)

**Delivery:**
- In-app
- Email
- Telegram (later)

This alone justifies a monthly subscription.

---

## 8. Daily EERI Intelligence Summary (Pro)

A daily auto-generated brief, tied to the index value.

**Example:**
> "EERI closed at 83 (CRITICAL), driven by war escalation and aviation disruption. Gas and freight remain the most exposed assets. Risk remains elevated compared to the 30-day baseline."

This is:
- Shareable
- Sticky
- High perceived value
- Cheap to generate (data already available)

---

## Optional Pro Add-Ons (for later tiers)

- EERI vs GERI comparison
- EERI vs Middle East RERI (when available)
- "What changed since yesterday?" delta view
- CSV / API export (Enterprise tier)

---

## Minimal Pro Feature Set (v1 lean start)

If starting with the tightest possible Pro v1:

- ✅ EERI vs Brent
- ✅ EERI vs TTF Gas
- ✅ EERI vs VIX
- ✅ EERI vs Freight
- ✅ Component Breakdown
- ✅ Top Drivers (full)
- ✅ Historical chart
- ✅ Daily summary text

**That alone is absolutely worth $49/month.**

---

## Strategic Pricing Insight

What we're offering is not data — it's:
- Context
- Interpretation
- Early signal
- Cross-asset intelligence

Most users cannot build this themselves.

The Pro dashboard should feel like:
> "I can't afford *not* to check this every day."

---

# Component Transparency — Deep Dive

## Why Component Transparency Exists

Most indices do this:
> "The index is 83."

That's it. No explanation. No context. No trust.

**EERI Pro does something different:**
> "The index is 83 — and here is why."

This is the moment where EnergyRiskIQ stops being a number and becomes **decision intelligence**.

---

## The Mental Model for Users

Users should intuitively understand EERI as:
> "A weighted combination of regional risk, themes, and market transmission."

Not formulas. Not math. **Forces.**

Each component answers a different question.

---

## The Four Conceptual Components

### 1. RERI_EU — Regional Risk Backbone

**Question it answers:**
> "How dangerous is the European geopolitical & energy environment right now?"

This is the structural layer:
- Captures war, sanctions, regional escalation
- Aggregates severity, clustering, velocity
- Slow-moving, but powerful
- Hard to fake, hard to ignore

**Conceptually:** This is the ground shaking under Europe.

If RERI_EU is high, EERI cannot be calm — no matter what markets do.

---

### 2. Theme Pressure — Narrative & Structural Stress

**Question it answers:**
> "What types of stress are dominating the risk landscape?"

**Themes include:**
- Geopolitical conflict
- Energy supply disruption
- Trade / logistics stress
- Policy & sanctions

Theme Pressure captures **breadth**, not just intensity:
- Many medium events → pressure builds
- Repeated narratives → structural risk
- Shows what *kind* of crisis this is

**Conceptually:** This is the story the world keeps telling you — louder and louder.

---

### 3. Asset Transmission — Market Reality Check

**Question it answers:**
> "Is this risk actually propagating into markets?"

This connects risk to:
- Gas
- Oil
- Freight
- FX

When multiple asset classes react together, risk is no longer theoretical.

**Conceptually:** This is the bridge between headlines and money.

It tells users: *"Markets are starting to feel it."*

---

### 4. Contagion (v2) — Spillover Risk

**Question it answers:**
> "Is risk spreading beyond Europe?"

- Middle East
- Black Sea
- Global trade corridors

This is about second-order effects.

**Conceptually:** This is fire jumping to the next building.

It's powerful, but only meaningful once regional indices mature — which is why it's v2.

---

## Why Show Normalized Values Only

This is extremely important.

**You are NOT showing:**
- Raw counts
- Internal math
- Proprietary scaling

**You ARE showing:**
> "Relative contribution to today's risk."

Normalized values answer:
- Which force mattered most today
- What changed since yesterday
- Where attention should go

Users don't care about raw math — they care about **dominance**.

---

## Visualization Options

### Stacked Bar — Composition View

**Best for:** "What is today made of?"

**Visually:**
- Each component occupies part of the bar
- Larger section = bigger influence

**User takeaway:**
> "Today's risk is mostly regional + market transmission."

---

### Donut — Balance View

**Best for:** "Which force dominates?"

**Visually:**
- Clean, intuitive
- Easy to compare proportions

**User takeaway:**
> "Theme pressure is unusually high today."

---

### Waterfall — Build-up View

**Best for:** "How did we get to 83?"

**Visually:**
- Start from baseline
- Each component pushes risk higher
- Ends at today's level

**User takeaway:**
> "Even if markets calm, regional risk alone keeps EERI elevated."

This is extremely powerful for analysts.

---

## The Key Psychological Shift for Pro Users

**Without this feature, users think:**
> "83 feels high."

**With this feature, users think:**
> "83 is high because regional escalation + gas + freight are all aligned."

That difference is everything.

---

## Why This Justifies Pro Pricing

This feature gives users:
- Explainability
- Confidence
- Trust
- Actionability

It answers:
- Can I trust this number?
- What should I watch today?
- Is this noise or systemic?

Most platforms hide this. **We monetize insight instead.**

---

## Dashboard UX Goal

The correct UX emotion is:
> "Ah. That makes sense."

**Not:**
- "How is this calculated?"
- "Is this arbitrary?"
- "Why should I trust this?"

---

## Strategic Note

We are not just explaining EERI. **We are educating users how to think about risk.**

Over time:
- They will stop checking prices first
- They will check EERI first
- Prices become confirmation, not signal

**That's how indices become indispensable.**

---

# Asset Stress Panel — Deep Dive

## Why the Asset Stress Panel Exists

Most users do this every day:
1. Scan news
2. Check charts
3. Guess which assets are affected
4. Decide where risk matters

That's slow. That's subjective. That's error-prone.

**The Asset Stress Panel answers one question instantly:**
> "Which markets are under stress today because of energy risk?"

Not tomorrow. Not in theory. **Today.**

---

## The Mental Model

Users should read this panel like a **risk radar**:
> "These are the asset classes currently absorbing the shock."

**It is NOT:**
- A forecast
- A trade signal
- A price target

**It IS:**
- Risk exposure mapping

---

## What Each Asset Row Represents

### 🔥 Gas — High

**What this tells the user:**
- European gas markets are under meaningful stress
- Supply narratives are active
- Sensitivity to headlines is elevated

**Conceptually:** Gas is the first responder in European energy crises.

**If Gas is "High":**
- Volatility risk is present
- Hedging costs may rise
- Downstream power prices may follow

---

### 🛢️ Oil — Elevated

**What this tells the user:**
- Oil is feeling spillover, not panic
- Risk is present but not dominant
- Oil is reacting to context, not leading it

**Conceptually:** Oil is aware, but not alarmed.

This distinction matters enormously to professionals.

---

### 🚢 Freight — Severe

**What this tells the user:**
- Logistics and trade routes are actively disrupted
- Physical constraints are binding
- Supply chain stress is real, not narrative

**Conceptually:** Freight is where geopolitical risk becomes physical reality.

This is often:
- The earliest confirmation of systemic stress
- A warning before prices fully react

---

### 💱 FX — Elevated

**What this tells the user:**
- Currency markets are repricing uncertainty
- Risk premiums are widening
- Capital is cautious, not fleeing

**Conceptually:** FX reflects confidence — Elevated means confidence is weakening.

---

## Why These Four Assets Together Are Powerful

Individually, they tell a story.
Together, they tell whether **risk is systemic**.

**Patterns users will learn:**

| Pattern | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Gas + Freight high | Physical supply stress |
| Oil + FX elevated | Macro spillover |
| All four high | Systemic shock |

This panel trains users to see **alignment**, not noise.

---

## Directional Bias (↑ ↓ ~)

This is subtle, but very powerful.

**It answers:**
> "Is stress increasing, easing, or stable?"

Not price direction. Not forecasts.

Just:
- **↑** Pressure building
- **↓** Pressure easing
- **~** Stable stress

**Conceptually:** This is momentum of *risk*, not momentum of *price*.

Professionals care deeply about this distinction.

---

## Color-coded Risk Bands — Fast Cognition

Colors are not decoration. They are **cognitive shortcuts**.

They allow users to:
- Absorb the situation in 2 seconds
- Compare assets instantly
- Spot shifts day-to-day

A glance should tell them:
> "Freight is flashing red. Everything else is amber."

That alone can change how someone trades or hedges.

---

## Why Traders and Analysts Love This Module

Because it:
- Saves time
- Reduces cognitive load
- Replaces guesswork
- Provides cross-asset context
- Works before price confirmation

This is the kind of panel that ends up:
- On a second monitor
- Checked every morning
- Referenced in daily notes

---

## The Emotional Reaction We Want

When a Pro user sees this panel, the reaction should be:
> "Okay — that's where the stress is."

**Not:**
- "What does this mean?"
- "How was this calculated?"
- "Is this subjective?"

It should feel **obvious and trustworthy**.

---

## Strategic Importance

This panel quietly does something huge:

It shifts the platform from:
> "Index provider"

to:
> "Risk intelligence system."

We are no longer just saying:
> "Risk is high"

We are saying:
> "Here is where risk lives today."

That is immensely valuable.

---

## Positioning

This panel should be:
- ✅ Pro-only
- ✅ Compact
- ✅ Always visible (above the fold)
- ✅ Stable in layout

Because over time, users will:
- Stop reading headlines first
- Start here

**That is product gravity.**

---

# Tooltips & Platform Integration

## 1. Tooltips That Educate Without Leaking IP

### The Golden Rule

A tooltip should answer **"what does this mean?"**,
never **"how is this calculated?"**.

We explain **interpretation**, not mechanics.

---

### Asset Stress Panel — Main Tooltip (panel title)

**Tooltip text:**
> **Asset Stress Snapshot**
> Shows where current energy-related risk is being absorbed across key asset classes.
> Levels reflect relative stress, not price direction or forecasts.

**What this does:**
- Sets expectations
- Prevents "is this a trade signal?" confusion
- Frames it as risk context

---

### 🔥 Gas — Tooltip

**Tooltip text:**
> **Gas — High**
> Indicates elevated sensitivity of European gas markets to current geopolitical and supply developments.
> High stress suggests increased volatility risk and heightened responsiveness to new events.

**What it teaches:**
- Sensitivity, not price
- Volatility, not direction
- Event-driven behavior

**What it doesn't reveal:**
- Inputs
- Thresholds
- Scaling logic

---

### 🛢️ Oil — Tooltip

**Tooltip text:**
> **Oil — Elevated**
> Signals meaningful spillover from energy and geopolitical risk into oil markets, without full systemic stress.
> Oil is reacting to context rather than leading risk dynamics.

**This subtly teaches:**
- Oil as secondary transmitter
- Difference between "elevated" and "severe"
- Market hierarchy

---

### 🚢 Freight — Tooltip

**Tooltip text:**
> **Freight — Severe**
> Reflects active disruption or constraint across logistics and trade routes linked to energy risk.
> Severe freight stress often precedes broader market transmission.

**This is powerful because:**
- It educates
- It positions freight as early signal
- It feels insightful, not technical

---

### 💱 FX — Tooltip

**Tooltip text:**
> **FX — Elevated**
> Indicates increased currency sensitivity to energy-related risk and geopolitical uncertainty.
> Elevated FX stress reflects cautious capital positioning rather than disorderly moves.

**Again:**
- Confidence framing
- No formulas
- No weights

---

### 🔺 Directional Bias Tooltip (↑ ↓ ~)

**Tooltip text:**
> **Directional Bias**
> Shows whether stress pressure is increasing, easing, or stable compared to recent conditions.
> This reflects momentum of risk, not price movement.

**This one is crucial:**
- Prevents misuse
- Trains users to think in risk momentum

---

### 🎨 Color Band Tooltip

**Tooltip text:**
> **Risk Bands**
> Colors represent relative stress intensity across assets for the current day.
> Bands are comparable across assets but do not imply equal price impact.

**This avoids:**
- "Red means sell" thinking
- Overinterpretation

---

## 2. Platform Integration

This is where the panel becomes a **hub**, not a widget.

---

### 🔔 Integration with Alerts

**Conceptual Flow:**

1. **Alert is generated**
   - War escalation
   - Supply disruption
   - Logistics issue

2. **Asset Stress Panel updates**
   - Relevant assets move from Elevated → High → Severe

3. **User sees alignment**
   - Alert explains *why*
   - Panel shows *where*

**How users experience this:**
> "An alert fired — and I can immediately see it's hitting Gas and Freight, not FX."

This dramatically increases:
- Alert credibility
- Actionability
- User confidence

**Key insight:**
> Alerts explain cause.
> Asset Stress shows impact.

---

### 📰 Integration with Daily Summaries

The Asset Stress Panel becomes the **summary anchor**.

**Example Daily Summary:**
> EERI closed at 83 (CRITICAL).
> Stress remains concentrated in Freight (Severe) and Gas (High), confirming physical supply-chain pressure.
> Oil and FX remain elevated, reflecting broader macro sensitivity.

**The magic:**
- The text mirrors the panel
- The panel validates the text
- No duplication, only reinforcement

**Users feel:**
> "This summary is grounded in something real."

---

### 📈 Integration with EERI vs Asset Charts

This is where professionals really engage.

**How the panel guides chart usage:**

The panel answers:
> "Which chart should I look at today?"

**Examples:**
- Freight = Severe → user clicks EERI vs Freight
- Gas = High → user opens EERI vs TTF
- FX = Elevated → user checks EERI vs FX index

We're guiding attention without telling them what to trade.

**Conceptual relationship:**
- Asset Stress Panel = snapshot (now)
- EERI vs Asset Chart = evolution (then → now)

**Users connect:**
> "Ah — freight stress turned severe before EERI accelerated."

That's insight.

---

## The Deeper Product Effect

Over time, users will learn patterns:
- Which assets lead
- Which lag
- Which confirm
- Which stay quiet

**We are teaching them a risk language.**

That's incredibly sticky.

---

## Final Strategic Takeaway

With:
- Carefully worded tooltips
- Clear separation of meaning vs mechanics
- Tight integration across alerts, summaries, and charts

We achieve three things at once:

| Goal | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| Educate users | They understand risk better |
| Protect our IP | No formulas exposed |
| Increase perceived sophistication | Platform feels professional |

**This is exactly how professional intelligence platforms scale trust.**

---

# Top Drivers Module — Deep Dive

## What Top Drivers Really Is

Forget headlines.

Conceptually, Top Drivers is a **ranked map of forces currently shaping EERI**.

It answers one core question:
> "What events actually matter for risk right now — and why?"

This is **decision support**, not information delivery.

---

## Public vs Pro: Why They Must Be Different

### Public View
- 2–3 headlines
- High-level narrative
- SEO and awareness
- Zero operational value (by design)

### Pro View
- Full ranked list
- Structured attributes
- Comparative context
- Actionable prioritization

**This separation is essential:**
- We protect IP
- We monetize insight
- We avoid being a news site

---

## The Mental Model for Pro Users

A Pro user should think:
> "These are the levers currently pushing risk higher — I need to focus here."

**Not:**
- "What's happening?"
- "What's trending?"

**But:**
- "What matters most?"

---

## What Each Driver Field Represents

### 📰 Headline

This is context, not the value.

**It answers:**
> "What is the event?"

But the headline alone is meaningless without the fields below.

---

### 🔥 Driver Class (High Impact / Spike)

**This answers:**
> "Is this structurally important or situational?"

| Class | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| **High Impact** | Structural, systemic, persistent. Can anchor risk for days or weeks. |
| **Spike** | Sudden, localized, often short-lived. Important for clustering detection. |

**Conceptually:** Driver class separates earthquakes from aftershocks.

---

### 🧠 Theme (Geopolitical / Energy / Supply Chain)

**This answers:**
> "What type of stress is this?"

Themes allow users to see:
- If risk is political
- If risk is physical supply
- If risk is logistical
- If risk is policy-driven

**Conceptually:** Themes explain the *nature* of the crisis, not just its size.

Over time, users learn:
- Which themes matter most for which assets
- Which themes tend to escalate
- Which fade quickly

---

### ⚠️ Severity

**This answers:**
> "How damaging is this event in isolation?"

**Severity is:**
- Intrinsic impact
- Independent of other events
- About potential, not confirmation

**Conceptually:** Severity is "how hard this could hit if it propagates."

---

### ✅ Confidence

**This answers:**
> "How reliable is this signal?"

**Confidence reflects:**
- Source credibility
- Cross-source confirmation
- Clarity of facts

**Conceptually:** Confidence tells users whether this is noise or signal.

Professionals care deeply about this.

---

### 🎯 Assets Affected

**This answers:**
> "Where does this risk show up?"

Gas, oil, freight, FX — this is the bridge between:
- Narrative
- Markets

**Conceptually:** This is where risk meets exposure. This is what turns a headline into a decision.

---

## Why Sorting Matters More Than Charts

Sorting is not UI sugar — it's **prioritization logic**.

| Sort Mode | Question Answered |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Sort by Severity** | "What could hurt the most?" |
| **Sort by Confidence** | "What can I trust the most?" |
| **Sort by Asset Overlap** | "What is most likely to propagate systemically?" |

**Users switch sort modes depending on mindset:**
- Morning scan → confidence
- Crisis mode → severity
- Portfolio review → asset overlap

This is how professionals think.

---

## Are Charts Needed Here?

**Short answer:** No charts are required — and adding them by default would be a mistake.

### Why Tables + Ranking Beat Charts for Top Drivers

Top Drivers is about:
- Comparison
- Prioritization
- Judgment

Charts are good for:
- Trends
- History
- Evolution

But Top Drivers is:
> "What matters now?"

**Tables win here because:**
- Faster cognition
- Better scanning
- Clear hierarchy
- Less distraction

This is a **decision console**, not an analytics view.

---

### When Charts Do Make Sense (Optional, Later)

If we ever add charts here, they should be **secondary and optional**, such as:
- Mini bar showing relative severity (no axes, no scales)
- Asset icons lighting up (visual cue, not chart)
- Hover-only micro-visuals

**Never:**
- Time series
- Line charts
- Overlays

Those belong elsewhere.

---

## How This Module Integrates

| Component | What It Tells |
|-----------|---------------|
| EERI number | How risky |
| Asset Stress Panel | Where |
| Top Drivers | Why |

Together, they form a complete loop:
> **Level → Location → Cause**

That's rare — and extremely powerful.

---

## The Psychological Effect on Pro Users

When this module is done right, users feel:
> "I don't need to read everything — I know where to focus."

**That reduces:**
- Cognitive overload
- Decision fatigue
- Noise exposure

This is why professionals pay.

---

## Final Strategic Verdict

**Top Drivers (Pro):**
- Is not content
- Is not news
- Is not charts
- Is not explanation

**It is structured judgment.**

And that is exactly what serious users want.

---

# Historical Intelligence — Deep Dive

This feature is quietly one of the most powerful things in EnergyRiskIQ.
It turns EERI from a daily reading into **institutional memory**.

---

## What Historical Intelligence Really Is

Most platforms show history like this:
> "Here's a line chart."

That's passive.

**Historical Intelligence does something else:**
> "Here's how risk behaves over time — and what usually follows."

It answers a deeper question:
> "Is today exceptional, or just more of the same?"

That distinction is everything.

---

## Why This Is a Moat (Strategically)

History is:
- Expensive to build
- Impossible to fake later
- Compounding in value
- Trust-building

Once you have it, competitors can't "catch up" quickly.

**Every day EERI runs, our moat widens.**

---

## 📊 EERI Daily History — The Baseline Memory

### What This View Conceptually Shows

Not just:
- Up
- Down

But:
- Regime shifts
- Persistence
- Clustering
- Calm vs crisis periods

**Users begin to recognize patterns like:**
- "Risk stays elevated longer than expected"
- "Sharp spikes usually revert"
- "Plateaus are more dangerous than peaks"

This is **risk literacy**.

---

## 🟥 Risk Band History — The Regime Lens

This is much more powerful than a raw chart.

### What It Answers
> "How often is Europe actually in trouble?"

**Showing:**
- % of days in NORMAL
- % in ELEVATED
- % in HIGH
- % in CRITICAL

**Conceptually:** This tells users whether risk is structural or episodic.

### Examples of Insights Users Get
- "CRITICAL is rare — today matters"
- "HIGH has become the new normal"
- "We've spent 40% of this quarter above 60"

This is the kind of insight executives care about.

---

## 🔁 Period Comparisons

### This Week vs Last Week

**Answers:**
> "Is risk accelerating, stabilizing, or fading?"

Even if the level is similar, the **trajectory** matters.

### This Month vs Last Month

**Answers:**
> "Are we in a different risk regime?"

Professionals care less about today vs yesterday
and more about **regime transitions**.

---

## 🧠 The Optional Advanced View

### "Last time EERI ≥ 80, what happened next?"

This is where the platform becomes **strategic, not reactive**.

### What This Question Really Means
> "When risk reached this level before, how did the world behave?"

**This view builds:**
- Pattern recognition
- Scenario awareness
- Expectation management

**It does not predict. It prepares.**

### How Users Think With This View

They don't ask:
> "Will prices go up or down?"

They ask:
> "What usually happens after stress reaches this level?"

**Examples:**
- Did volatility stay high?
- Did risk fade quickly?
- Did markets overreact?
- Did second-order effects appear?

**This is incredibly valuable to:**
- Risk managers
- Portfolio managers
- Policy analysts

---

## Why This Must Be Pro-Only

Because this is:
- Accumulated intelligence
- Hard-earned signal
- Non-replicable
- Time-based IP

**Public users should never see:**
- Pattern statistics
- Regime persistence
- Historical analogs

This is institutional insight, not marketing.

---

## The Emotional Effect on Pro Users

When users have this, they feel:
> "I've seen this before."

**That feeling is:**
- Calming
- Empowering
- Confidence-building

**It reduces:**
- Overreaction
- Noise trading
- Panic decisions

That's real value.

---

## How This Ties Everything Together

| Component | What It Provides |
|-----------|------------------|
| Today's EERI | Current state |
| Top Drivers | Causes |
| Asset Stress Panel | Impact |
| Historical Intelligence | Perspective |

This completes the loop:
> **Now → Why → Where → What usually follows**

Very few platforms do this well.

---

## Final Strategic Verdict

Historical Intelligence is not a feature.

**It is:**
- Memory
- Context
- Wisdom
- Differentiation

This is what turns EnergyRiskIQ into a **reference system**, not a dashboard.

---

# Alerts & Thresholds — Deep Dive

This feature is where EERI stops being something users "check" and becomes something that **watches the world for them**.

Conceptually, Alerts & Thresholds transform the index from information into **delegation**.

---

## What Alerts & Thresholds Really Are

Most alert systems notify users when prices move.

**Our alerts notify users when risk changes state.**

That's a completely different (and far more valuable) proposition.

**The core promise is:**
> "I don't need to monitor risk constantly — EERI will tell me when it matters."

---

## Why Thresholds Matter Psychologically

Humans are bad at monitoring continuous signals.

**Thresholds turn a continuous index into discrete moments of attention.**

Instead of asking:
- "Is 58 high?"
- "Is 63 worse?"
- "Is 79 dangerous?"

Users think:
- "We crossed into HIGH risk."
- "We entered CRITICAL."
- "Something just changed."

This reduces ambiguity and decision fatigue.

---

## The Meaning of Each Threshold

### 🔔 EERI ≥ 60 — High Risk Regime

**This answers:**
> "Should I start paying close attention?"

- Risk is no longer background noise
- Clustering is forming
- Sensitivity to news increases

**This is an early-warning alert.**

---

### 🔔 EERI ≥ 70 — Severe Risk Regime

**This answers:**
> "Should I review exposure and assumptions?"

- Systemic stress is present
- Multiple components are aligned
- Secondary effects are likely

**This is a prepare-to-act alert.**

---

### 🔔 EERI ≥ 80 — Critical Risk Regime

**This answers:**
> "Is the system under real strain right now?"

- Crisis conditions
- Market behavior may decouple from fundamentals
- Non-linear moves become more likely

**This is a pay-attention-now alert.**

---

## Why Day-Over-Day Change Alerts Are Essential

Levels tell you where you are.
**Changes tell you what's happening.**

**Δ ≥ X alerts answer:**
> "Did risk accelerate suddenly?"

**This catches:**
- Surprise escalations
- Rapid clustering
- Narrative shifts
- Shock events

Even if the level stays below 60, a sharp jump matters.

**Conceptually:** Velocity alerts detect surprises.

---

## How Users Actually Use These Alerts

Professionals don't act on alerts alone.

**They use alerts to:**
- Interrupt their day
- Reprioritize attention
- Open the dashboard with purpose

**An alert is not the decision — it is the permission to stop ignoring risk.**

---

## Delivery Channels

### 📱 In-App

This is the **context-rich** channel.

**Used when:**
- User is already thinking about risk
- They want to explore deeper
- They want explanations

**In-app alerts feel:**
- Analytical
- Calm
- Professional

---

### 📧 Email

This is the **reflective** channel.

**Used when:**
- Users review risk once or twice a day
- They want summaries, not noise
- They archive intelligence

**Email alerts feel:**
- Authoritative
- Non-urgent
- Considered

---

### 💬 Telegram (Later)

This is the **interrupt** channel.

**Used when:**
- Risk shifts quickly
- Users need instant awareness
- Attention is scarce

**Telegram alerts feel:**
- Immediate
- High-signal
- Minimal

**Important:** The same alert should feel different depending on the channel — not louder, just more concise.

---

## Why This Feature Alone Justifies Subscription

Because it replaces:
- Manual monitoring
- Constant checking
- Fear of missing escalation
- Cognitive load

With:
> "I'll know when it matters."

**That peace of mind is worth far more than $49/month.**

---

## How Alerts Connect to the Rest of the System

Alerts are not standalone.

**They should always connect to:**

| After Alert | User Asks |
|-------------|-----------|
| EERI value | "What changed?" |
| Top Drivers | "Why did it change?" |
| Asset Stress Panel | "Where does it matter?" |
| Historical context | "Is this unusual?" |

**Alerts are the entry point into intelligence.**

---

## The Subtle But Powerful Design Choice

We should never allow:
- Too many thresholds
- Over-customization
- Constant noise

**Why?**

Because:
> A quiet alert system is trusted.
> A noisy one is ignored.

**This restraint is a feature, not a limitation.**

---

## Final Conceptual Takeaway

Alerts & Thresholds turn EERI into:
- A guardian
- A sentry
- A filter
- A focus tool

**They don't tell users what to do.**
**They tell users when to care.**

And that is one of the most valuable services we can provide.

# Daily EERI Intelligence Summary — Deep Dive

This feature is the **voice** of EnergyRiskIQ.
Conceptually, it turns EERI from a number into a daily narrative that professionals rely on.

---

## What the Daily EERI Intelligence Summary Really Is

**It is NOT:**
- A news recap
- A market commentary
- An opinion piece
- A forecast

**It IS:**
> A concise, authoritative risk briefing — written once per day, whether the world is calm or chaotic.

**Think of it as:**
- A morning intelligence note
- A daily situation report
- A risk desk handover

---

## The Mental Model for Users

When a Pro user reads the summary, they should feel:
> "I'm up to speed — I know the risk state today."

**They don't need:**
- All the headlines
- All the charts
- All the data

**They need orientation.**

---

## Why Tying It to the Index Value Is Critical

The summary always starts with the index state:
> "EERI closed at 83 (CRITICAL)…"

**This anchors everything.**

It immediately answers:
- How bad is it?
- Is this normal?
- Should I care today?

Everything else is explanation.

---

## The Four Conceptual Pillars

Each summary should implicitly answer four questions — every day.

### 1️⃣ Where Are We? (Level & Regime)

This is the opening sentence.

**It tells the reader:**
- Risk level
- Risk band
- Whether this is unusual

**Example concept:**
> "Risk remains in CRITICAL territory."

This sets the frame.

---

### 2️⃣ Why Are We Here? (Drivers)

**This explains:**
- What forces mattered most
- What themes dominated
- What kind of risk this is

Not a list of headlines — a **distillation**.

**Conceptually:**
> "These are the few things that moved the needle."

---

### 3️⃣ Where Does It Matter? (Assets)

This translates risk into exposure.

**Users immediately learn:**
- Which markets are absorbing stress
- Which are relatively insulated

**This bridges:** Risk → Reality

---

### 4️⃣ How Does This Compare? (Context)

This is the stabilizer.

**By comparing to:**
- 7-day average
- 30-day average
- Recent regimes

**You prevent:**
- Overreaction
- Alarm fatigue

**You give perspective:**
> "This is elevated — but not unprecedented."

---

## Why This Is So Sticky

Professionals love routines.

**This summary:**
- Arrives once per day
- Is short
- Is reliable
- Is consistent in tone and structure

**It becomes:**
- A daily check-in
- A habit
- A reference point

Over time, users feel uncomfortable *not* reading it.

**That's stickiness.**

---

## Why It Is Shareable

The summary is:
- Neutral
- Non-promotional
- Non-technical
- Insightful

**That makes it safe to:**
- Forward internally
- Paste into Slack
- Share with colleagues
- Reference in meetings

This creates organic distribution without leaking IP.

---

## Why Perceived Value Is High

From the user's perspective:
> "Someone intelligent looked at a lot of complex data and told me what matters."

**That feels expensive.**

Even though:
- We already have the data
- We already computed the index
- We already know the drivers

**We are monetizing interpretation, not computation.**

---

## Why It's Cheap (Strategically)

Once the system exists:
- No new data sources
- No manual work
- No editorial team
- No human bottleneck

Yet users perceive:
- Judgment
- Insight
- Curation

**This is leverage.**

---

## How It Fits Into the Broader Product Loop

The Daily Summary is the **daily gateway**:

```
Alert fires → user reads summary
Summary sparks interest → user opens dashboard
Dashboard confirms → user trusts the system
```

It closes the loop between:
> **Notification → Explanation → Exploration**

---

## Why This Feature Is Pro-Only

Because it is:
- Interpretive
- Contextual
- Synthesized

**Public users should see:**
- Numbers
- Headlines
- Fragments

**Pro users get:**
> The story those fragments tell.

That distinction is everything.

---

## The Emotional Payoff

After reading the Daily EERI Intelligence Summary, users should feel:
> "I'm not guessing today."

**That confidence is addictive — and extremely valuable.**

---

## Final Strategic Takeaway

This feature quietly does something huge:

**It positions EnergyRiskIQ as:**
- A daily intelligence service
- Not a dashboard
- Not a feed
- Not a tool

**But a trusted daily briefing.**

That's how platforms become indispensable.

---

# Core Pro Charts — Deep Dive

This is the analytical spine of the Pro dashboard.
Conceptually, these charts are not about "watching lines move" — they are about understanding **how risk propagates into markets**.

---

## What Core Pro Charts Really Represent

Most financial charts answer:
> "What did the price do?"

**Our charts answer:**
> "How did risk express itself through markets?"

This is a fundamental inversion.

We are not plotting markets to explain risk.
**We are plotting markets to observe risk transmission.**

That is extremely powerful.

---

## The Conceptual Purpose of Overlay Charts

Overlaying EERI with an asset is not about correlation coefficients.

**It is about sequence and alignment.**

**Users look for:**
- Who moves first
- Who follows
- Who resists
- When divergence appears

This is how professionals detect regime change.

---

## EERI vs Brent Crude

### Risk → Oil Transmission

**What this chart conceptually answers:**
> "When energy risk rises, does oil react immediately, later, or not at all?"

**This reveals:**
- Whether oil is leading or lagging risk
- Whether oil is pricing geopolitical stress
- Whether markets are complacent or alert

**Key insight users learn over time:**
> "Risk often rises before oil reacts — and when oil finally moves, it's rarely subtle."

This chart trains users to see oil as a **confirmation layer**, not the primary signal.

---

## EERI vs TTF Gas

### Europe-Specific Stress Sensor

This is one of our highest-value charts.

**What it answers:**
> "Is European energy risk already embedded in gas markets?"

**Gas is:**
- Local
- Physical
- Sensitive
- Fast

**This chart shows:**
- Direct transmission
- Non-linear reactions
- Stress accumulation

**Conceptually:**
> If EERI rises and TTF follows, the risk is real.
> If EERI rises and TTF doesn't, something is being ignored.

This is gold for analysts.

---

## EERI vs European Gas (Front-Month)

### Immediate Physical Exposure

This variant emphasizes:
- Near-term constraints
- Storage anxiety
- Supply fear

**Conceptually:**
> Front-month gas is where fear shows up first.

**Users learn:**
- Long-dated markets may stay calm
- Front-month doesn't lie

This chart is about **urgency**.

---

## EERI vs VIX

### Energy Risk vs Macro Fear

This chart answers a very subtle question:
> "Is this an energy-specific crisis, or part of a broader market panic?"

**Key insights:**

| Pattern | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| EERI ↑, VIX flat | Localized energy risk |
| Both ↑ | Systemic stress |
| VIX ↑, EERI flat | Macro noise |

**Conceptually:**
> This chart separates energy-driven risk from everything-else risk.

This prevents misinterpretation.

---

## EERI vs Freight Index

### From Geopolitics to Physical Disruption

This chart is about **reality**.

**Freight is:**
- Slow
- Physical
- Hard to manipulate
- Highly informative

**Conceptually:**
> Freight moves when the world actually breaks.

**If EERI spikes and freight follows:**
- Supply chains are strained
- Bottlenecks are forming
- Delays are real

This chart often confirms risk after headlines — but **before full economic impact**.

---

## Why Overlay + Toggle + Zoom Matter

These are not UI features — they are **cognitive tools**.

| Control | Question It Answers |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Overlay** | "Do these move together or apart?" |
| **Toggle** | "What happens if I isolate one signal?" |
| **Zoom** | "Is this a short-term shock or a regime shift?" |

**These interactions allow users to:**
- Ask better questions
- Avoid false conclusions
- Build intuition over time

---

## The Key Inversion: Risk → Price

This is our defining insight.

**Most platforms assume:**
> Price moves → risk increases

**We show:**
> Risk accumulates → price eventually reacts

**This reframes how users think about:**
- Early warning
- Market complacency
- Surprise moves

It's subtle — and extremely valuable.

---

## How Professionals Actually Use These Charts

They don't stare at them all day.

**They:**
- Check them when alerts fire
- Use them to confirm or challenge narratives
- Reference them in internal discussions
- Learn patterns over time

**These charts become contextual validators.**

---

## Emotional Effect on Pro Users

When users see these charts, the feeling should be:
> "This explains what I'm seeing in the market."

**Not:**
- "I need to calculate correlation"
- "What does this mean?"
- "Is this overfitted?"

**Clarity beats complexity.**

---

## Strategic Importance

**These charts:**
- Anchor the Pro plan
- Differentiate us from news platforms
- Differentiate us from pure data vendors
- Build long-term user intuition

They are not replaceable by ChatGPT, Bloomberg, or TradingView.

---

## Final Conceptual Takeaway

These charts are not about visuals.

**They are about teaching users how risk behaves.**

Once someone learns that:
> "Risk leads, markets follow"

They will never look at markets the same way again.

**And they will keep coming back.**

---

# Advanced Time Controls — Deep Dive

This feature is subtle on the surface — but conceptually it's one of the clearest signals that the platform is built for **professionals, not casual viewers**.

Advanced Time Controls don't exist to "add options".
They exist to let users **ask different analytical questions of the same data**.

---

## What Advanced Time Controls Really Represent

Most dashboards decide how users should look at data.

**Analyst-grade systems let users decide how they want to think.**

**These controls give users:**
- Perspective
- Agency
- Precision

They turn charts from pictures into **instruments**.

---

## The Core Mental Shift: From Viewing to Interrogating

**Without controls, users ask:**
> "What does this chart show?"

**With controls, users ask:**
> "What happens if I look at this differently?"

That's the difference between:
- Retail dashboards
- Professional analysis tools

---

## ⏱️ Time Ranges — Changing the Question, Not the Data

Each time range corresponds to a different analytical intent.

### 7D — Shock & Reaction View

**Answers:**
> "What just happened?"

**Used for:**
- Crisis monitoring
- Alert follow-ups
- Sudden escalations

**This is where users spot:**
- Abrupt divergence
- Fast reactions
- Market surprise

---

### 30D — Regime Formation View

**Answers:**
> "Is this persisting?"

**Used for:**
- Stress accumulation
- Confirmation of narratives
- Early regime shifts

Professionals often trust 30D more than 7D — it filters noise.

---

### 90D — Structural Context View

**Answers:**
> "Is this exceptional or part of a longer trend?"

**Used for:**
- Strategic positioning
- Risk budgeting
- Policy or macro analysis

**This timeframe reveals:**
- Cycles
- Plateaus
- False alarms

---

### Since Launch — Historical Identity View

**Answers:**
> "How unusual is today?"

**This creates:**
- Perspective
- Confidence
- Memory

**Users learn:**
- What "normal" looks like
- How often extremes occur

This is where intuition is built.

---

## 🔀 Toggle Modes — Isolating Meaning

Toggles don't change the chart.
**They change what the user is paying attention to.**

### Index Only — Pure Risk Signal

**Answers:**
> "What is risk doing on its own?"

**Used when:**
- Users want clarity
- Markets are noisy
- Confirmation bias needs to be avoided

This builds trust in EERI as an independent signal.

---

### Asset Only — Market Behavior Lens

**Answers:**
> "What is the market doing, ignoring risk?"

**Used when:**
- Users suspect market denial or overreaction
- They want to see if price action stands alone

**This helps identify:**
- Complacency
- Panic
- Overpricing

---

### Overlay Mode — Transmission Analysis

**Answers:**
> "How is risk flowing into this market?"

This is the most powerful mode.

**Users look for:**
- Lag
- Lead
- Divergence
- Alignment

**This is where insight happens.**

---

## 📉 Smoothing — Separating Signal from Noise

Smoothing is not cosmetic.
**It is epistemic — it affects what users believe.**

### Raw — Event Sensitivity

**Answers:**
> "How reactive is this?"

**Used when:**
- Monitoring live escalation
- Evaluating alerts
- Watching short-term shock

**Raw views capture:**
- Jumps
- Gaps
- Sharp reactions

---

### 3-Day MA — Tactical Clarity

**Answers:**
> "Is this move holding?"

**Used for:**
- Short-term validation
- Noise reduction without delay

This is often the default for active professionals.

---

### 7-Day MA — Structural Confirmation

**Answers:**
> "Is this a real shift?"

**Used for:**
- Regime analysis
- Strategic decisions
- Avoiding overreaction

If the 7-day MA moves, something meaningful is happening.

---

## Why These Controls Signal "Analyst-Grade"

**Retail platforms:**
- Show one view
- Assume one interpretation
- Optimize for aesthetics

**Analyst platforms:**
- Offer multiple lenses
- Respect uncertainty
- Let users test assumptions

**Our controls say:**
> "We trust you to think."

That's a powerful message.

---

## The Psychological Effect on Pro Users

With these controls, users feel:
- In control
- Respected
- Capable
- Grounded

They are not being sold a story —
**they are being given tools to form one.**

---

## How This Integrates with the Dashboard

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Alerts | Bring users in |
| Time Controls | Help them investigate |
| Charts | Show dynamics |
| Top Drivers | Explain causes |
| Historical Intelligence | Provide memory |

**Advanced Time Controls are the navigation system through all of that.**

---

## Final Conceptual Takeaway

These controls don't make the dashboard more complex.

**They make it more honest.**

They acknowledge:
- Markets are noisy
- Risk is multi-scale
- Insight requires perspective

**And that's exactly what professionals expect.**
