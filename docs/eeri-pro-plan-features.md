# EERI Pro Plan Dashboard Features (Recommended)

## 1. Core Pro Charts (the backbone)

These are must-have — the backbone of the Pro experience.

### Correlation & Overlay Charts

Each chart should allow overlay + toggle + zoom.

| Chart | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **EERI vs Brent Crude** | Spot regime shifts (risk → oil response lag) |
| **EERI vs TTF Gas** | Europe-specific stress signal (very strong value) |
| **EERI vs European Gas (front-month)** | Direct gas market correlation |
| **EERI vs VIX** | Macro risk vs energy-specific divergence |
| **EERI vs Freight Index** | Supply-chain & logistics transmission |

**Pro insight:** Most platforms show price → risk. We show risk → price.

---

## 2. Advanced Time Controls (Pro-only)

Give users control, not just charts.

**Time ranges:**
- 7D / 30D / 90D / Since Launch

**Toggle:**
- Index only
- Asset only
- Overlay mode

**Smoothing:**
- Raw
- 3-day MA
- 7-day MA

This makes the dashboard feel analyst-grade, not retail.

---

## 3. Component Transparency (Pro-exclusive)

This is where Pro really earns its price.

### EERI Component Breakdown

Show normalized values only (never raw):
- RERI_EU contribution
- Theme Pressure
- Asset Transmission
- (Later) Contagion

**Visualize as:**
- Stacked bar
- Donut
- Waterfall

➡️ Users see *why* today is 83, not just *that* it is.

---

## 4. Asset Stress Panel (Highly Valuable)

A compact but powerful module.

### Asset Stress Snapshot

| Asset | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Gas | High |
| Oil | Elevated |
| Freight | Severe |
| FX | Elevated |

**Optional:**
- Directional bias (↑ ↓ ~)
- Color-coded risk bands

This is extremely attractive to traders and analysts.

---

## 5. Top Drivers — Full Version (Pro)

Public sees 2–3 headlines. Pro sees the real engine.

**For each driver:**
- Headline
- Driver class (high impact / spike)
- Theme (geopolitical, energy, supply chain)
- Severity
- Confidence
- Assets affected

**Sort by:**
- Severity
- Confidence
- Asset overlap

This is decision support, not news.

---

## 6. Historical Intelligence (Pro-only)

This is one of the strongest moats.

### Historical Views

- EERI history (daily)
- Risk band history (% of time in CRITICAL, HIGH, etc.)

**Compare:**
- This week vs last week
- This month vs last month

**Optional advanced view:**
- "Last time EERI ≥ 80, what happened next?"

---

## 7. Alerts & Thresholds (Pro)

Let users interact with the index.

**Notify when:**
- EERI crosses 60 / 70 / 80
- Sharp day-over-day change (Δ ≥ X)

**Delivery:**
- In-app
- Email
- Telegram (later)

This alone justifies a monthly subscription.

---

## 8. Daily EERI Intelligence Summary (Pro)

A daily auto-generated brief, tied to the index value.

**Example:**
> "EERI closed at 83 (CRITICAL), driven by war escalation and aviation disruption. Gas and freight remain the most exposed assets. Risk remains elevated compared to the 30-day baseline."

This is:
- Shareable
- Sticky
- High perceived value
- Cheap to generate (data already available)

---

## Optional Pro Add-Ons (for later tiers)

- EERI vs GERI comparison
- EERI vs Middle East RERI (when available)
- "What changed since yesterday?" delta view
- CSV / API export (Enterprise tier)

---

## Minimal Pro Feature Set (v1 lean start)

If starting with the tightest possible Pro v1:

- ✅ EERI vs Brent
- ✅ EERI vs TTF Gas
- ✅ EERI vs VIX
- ✅ EERI vs Freight
- ✅ Component Breakdown
- ✅ Top Drivers (full)
- ✅ Historical chart
- ✅ Daily summary text

**That alone is absolutely worth $49/month.**

## Strategic Pricing Insight

What we're offering is not data — it's:
- Context
- Interpretation
- Early signal
- Cross-asset intelligence

Most users cannot build this themselves.

The Pro dashboard should feel like:
> "I can't afford *not* to check this every day."
